Amd,Mkilbride,31,1,"ASUS G15 Strix AMD Advantage Edition (Internal VS External) - basically, does a mux really matter much? I'd say...only a little and only in CPU bound situations.https://www.3dmark.com/compare/fs/25773868/fs/25806699

https://www.3dmark.com/compare/spy/21014607/spy/21134666

So these results might seem strange. Using an external display, I guess allowed some more power to the CPU, because it wasn't being used for the iGPU? Graphics performance seems identical / within the margin of error. 

As you approach higher resolutions, 4K, 1440p, ect, it matters less. At this point, most games on the internal screen already run well over 150FPS @ 1080p. With the GPU mostly maxed out too. 

But how does this translate to 1080p, since this thing has a 300HZ screen, a little more CPU headroom would surely help, right? And yes, it does, a good bit at least in Strange Brigade. 

https://i.imgur.com/13W0v8Y.png

I want you to keep in mind, these results seem really good, and would argue in favor of a mux - that Strange Brigade is amazingly well optimized for a title. You can see many benchmarks out there showcasing the ability for say, a 3080 to play it at 4K360HZ with almost no frame dips.  Not a lot of games are that well optimized. 

Now I was in a rush and will do more benchmarks of some other games tomorrow, the other one I did is FFXIV Shadowbringers, which is a MMORPG&lt; but has a good gamut of CPU bound and GPU bound scenarios due to that.

https://i.imgur.com/RredWdX.png

Both were run at ""Maximum"" settings. 

Now, according to ASUS, a Mux switch would've made them have to redesign their entire layout, and additional parts would've added another 200-250$ to the price. We see in this Laptops that cost far more than it already and it matches their performance even without a mux.  So yes, maybe ASUS should sell an Advantage+ Edition with one or something, but I am more than happy for a laptop under 1500$ to provide this kind of performance.

And if you wanna bitch about the poor stock RAM it comes with, know that Lenuvo is also doing it in their ""Pro"" lineup, while costing significantly more.

Now, if you're using this as a portable, due to lack of mux, the battery life is incredible. I can get almost 2 hours of medium gaming loads on the battery, and with keeping the refresh at 300. If I go to 60, even more.

Watching movies / TV shows it could last me 7-8 hours...but I run it at 90-100% brightness, keep that in mind. I also use MadVR, so it's using more than most people would when watching media. 

And if you're using this as a Desktop replacement, then the lack of a Mux Switch literally doesn't matter and you just saved yourself some good money. :P"

Amd,Pierredalique,16,1,"Please help me decide with MoBo for 5600x. Agony of choise.Hello everyone. 
I'm going to finally update my CPU from current 6600k to 5600x. Choosing the CPU was the easiest part. Now I'm in the tough state of choosing a ""perfect"" motherboard for that. Other main specs are GTX 1070Ti and a 500W PSU (which I'm not willing to change right now)

Candidates:

At first I was totally sure about B550 and narrowed option to basically two motherboards

-Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming (Wi-Fi) - 156€ (currently on a discount until the end of a day. Usual price ~180€)

-GigaByte B550 Aorus Pro AC - 174€

And it's already a struggle to choose between them. My current board is Asus maximus and it's good, but i don't like the asus software. Second doubt about asus is vrm. However, at Hardware Unboxed temps are even better than gigabyte's

Then I started looking at X570. The reason is that in the future I'd like to get a second m2 ssd and i don't want to loose 2 sata ports, which is a usual thing with b550.

So, options here are:

-MSI MAG X570 Tomahawk WiFi - 210€

-GigaByte X570 Aorus Ultra - 233€

But that's already very expensive, especially gigabyte one. Unfortunately, there is no elite or pro with wifi in Europe. Also getting a x570 pro at 200 € doesn't make sense cause Bluetooth adapter will cost about 20-30€.

Psychologically it's very difficult to get an expensive mobo at a price almost equal to the price of cpu.

Which drives me to the idea do i really need those 2 sata ports? (Though currently I use all 6 of them)

I do plan to OC both cpu and ram, but nothing extreme.

What would you get on my place? Do i miss anything?
Appreciate any help and sorry for yet another ""mobo for 5600x"" thread"

Amd,caldon724,7,1,"Temporary overclocking &amp; warranty (RX 6700 XT FE)Hi,

Does someone know how product warranty is handled if you overclock your gpu for a limited time? Specifically, I wanted to try out overclocking by adjusting core clock and power consumption, maybe vram, too (but without changing voltage).

If I tried this out and tested it for a couple weeks, then switch back to non-overclocked state, would my warranty still be valid? If then sometime later a hardware failure would occur (non-overclocked) could I still hope for support?

So far I always assumed it works like this: If I ever start using the card outside of its specifications, a “switch” is flipped internally and everything’s counting as overclocked from here on. But is this really the case? Maybe someone has any experience regarding this topic?"

I know this isn’t some extreme power build. But it is my first build since switching over from an AlienWare laptop. My computer does everything and plays everything I’ve wanted to. It was my budget build right before the pandemic. Yes I’d love to get something more powerful and modern but with prices right now I’d like to hold out for some time. Back then I just got an inexpensive monitor because the price was very good and seemed like it could do what I needed (Acer Nitro 21.5” 1920x1080 75Hz IPS specifically VG220Q bmiix model). But I’d like to upgrade. So I’m asking what would be the best monitor I could get or just spec wise to get the most out of my system with a budget of about $400 tops. Most I’ve been looking at are more around the low $300 range if not less. So 1080p and higher refresh? 1440p? As I said before I’d like to upgrade later on, more likely just a whole new build. Something along the lines of 3060 and up if not a 2080 or equivalent. So would a 1440p 144Hz be too much and not play well? Asking so if that would be better to buy a higher quality monitor for more powerful setup later on. Apologies as this stuff is still somewhat new to me. I don’t hold any particular loyalty to any brand or size. Maybe something with Freesync if I’m able to? Flat or curved monitors? (I’m guessing not in the 24”-27” due to different panels). Thank you.

As for the dust, if you place your cooling pad and your laptop on a clean surface free of dust, then there shouldn't be any problem right ? My only concern is with cooling pads making laptop's fans spin faster, is it true ? If so, does it really damage the fans in the long run ?

So I bought a second hand card a while ago. The first owner was using a waterblock and I think he might have misplaced the thermal pads when he assembled the stock cooler on. I was looking for video or photo where I can see the correct places for thermal pads, but I was not lucky. 

So here I am asking if you guys have a schematic or something?

**New UEFI BIOS updates** 

**For ASUS AMD motherboards – W21**

\*Please do not ask about motherboards not listed. Please review the FAQ below for details.  
 

**AMD – X570, B550**  


**\*Important update notice – There will not be a formal release of AEGSA 1.2.0.2 instead there will be a transition to the AMD recommend AEGSA build 1.2.0.3. The release of this build starts this week with the B550 boards noted in the update list and will be released for other 400/500 series AMD ASUS motherboards over the coming weeks.**  
**AGESA V2 PI 1.2.0.3 Patch A is included with all B550 boards noted in the update list below.**  
 

**We expect a formal release of this new AGESA by the end of next month.**  
 

**UEFI BIOS update list noted below – A total of 25 boards with a UEFI BIOS update.**

**W21 is in relation to the workweek, these updates were released between May 24th – May 27th**

&amp;#x200B;

***Why is my motherboard not listed?***

It may have been recently updated. Check https://www.asus.com/us/support/ to see if it has been. I post updates on a weekly basis. UEFI’s are released in waves, because of this it can take an entire series weeks or months to see the “same” update if it includes items like CPU firmware. Furthermore, keep in mind that not all updates are applicable to all models. Due to inherent design differences as well as specification and feature variation an update may only be applicable to a specific model.

***How can I be notified about UEFI updates when they are released?***

If you want to be kept in the loop, you can also follow me for notifications when updates are released/posted. I am also the admin for our PCDIY Facebook Group where I post updates and other ASUS centric product news https://www.facebook.com/groups/ASUSPCDIY

***How long after a board is produced will UEFI updates be released?***

Keep in mind that generally after a year a motherboard reaches a certain maturity level and as such will see fewer updates. If you feel you have an issue that is dependent on a UEFI release, please submit a support ticket. In some cases, some boards can see updates for more than 24 months+

***I want to update but am not sure how to update the UEFI ""BIOS""?***

If you want guidance on how to flash/update your UEFI BIOS please watch the video linked below.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scK8AP8ZACc)

***Should I update the UEFI if my system is stable and running without issue?***

If your system is running without issue, especially if overclocked in any way ( including DRAM ) it is advised you stay on the build/release you are on. Changes to underlying auto rules and other operating parameters can change the OC experience and require you to retune a previously stable OC value. This does not mean the UEFI is not a functioning release but that changes in the underlying code base need to be accounted for when tuning a system. As many of these values are in low level or specific operating parameters it is best to retune from full UEFI defaults after you have re-run stability test at UEFI defaults.

***What if the UEFI BIOS listed is a BETA? Should I update?***

BETA UEFI releases are for enthusiasts who want access to the latest features, functions, and microcode enhancements, and overall UEFI improvements. As they are not officially supported, they are not recommended for day-to-day / long-term use. Users who plan to use their system in this capacity and want to ensure the best interoperability/compatibility and stability, as well as performance, should wait for a formal release.  
 

***How long does it take for a formal release to be issued (between BETA and formal)?***

  
The time span between a BETA and formal release can vary depending on multiple factors including new internal code being provided, validation and qualification as well as other important aspects of UEFI development and validation. Generally, you will see a formal release within 1 to 3 months. In some cases, BETAs are singular releases and will not see a formal release.

***Will a UEFI ""BIOS"" update improve the performance of my system?***

A UEFI update can include CPU microcode as well as other performance tuning enhancements that can influence/increase performance. With this noted it is generally minimal. As always performance analysis/comparisons should be done at stock-to-stock values. This means loading F5 on both releases and comparing your application/benchmark scores. OC-related comparisons may require retuning prior to testing as changes to underlying auto rules can invalidate prior scores even if with similar settings.

***Not every user should update/flash their UEFI BIOS. I stress this again, if you are running without issue(s) you are advised to stay on the release you are running.*** 

***Notes to consider -***

***\* When flashing please perform the update process at full UEFI defaults. Do NOT flash with an overclocked system/profile.***

1.I recommend updating the UEFI BIOS on your motherboard for new PC builds. This helps to ensure the best interoperability, compatibility, and performance. If you are building a PC and have not yet installed the OS, I would recommend you update the UEFI.

2.Keep in mind flashing/updating the UEFI will reset all defined parameters/settings and operating profiles. You will not be able to restore defined values by using a UEFI Profile as profiles are not interoperable between builds. It is advised you note or screenshot (F12) your values prior to flashing if they are complex. Upon completing a flash, I would recommend you load UEFI defaults after the fact and complete a full reboot and shutdown prior to re-entering your prior values. Keep in mind you may need to retune these values under a new UEFI.

3.When you update the UEFI and re-load UEFI defaults depending on your originally defined CSM/UEFI device parameters you may experience BOOT issues. Depending on prior settings you may need to enable or disable CSM to restore BOOT functionality.

4.Be advised that in some cases a rollback to a prior UEFI is not possible. This generally is the case when there is an update that includes CPU microcode (such as an AMD AEGSA or Intel ME). This means you may not be able to “flashback” to a prior release.

5.While not always necessary some UEFI updates may require a clearing of the CMOS. You can either clear the CMOS via the CLR CMOS button if your motherboard has this feature/function or you can also CLR CMOS by removing the onboard CMOS battery for at least a few minutes. You can also attempt to locate the CLR CMOS jumper on the motherboard and short the pins.

6.In some cases, you may not be able to jump from an older UEFI release to a much newer release. You may need to ""step"" update, this will mean upgrading incrementally to a slightly newer build first prior to going to the most recent build/release. In most situations this not required.

I also recommend you backup your system prior to any flash/update and always advise flash/update become executed from a fresh loading (F5) of UEFI defaults.

There are really some great insights into the turnaround of AMD and ZEN:

&gt;The funny thing was, we knew we were kind of at the end of the road -  our customers weren’t buying our products, and the stuff on the roadmap  wasn’t any good. I didn’t have to convince people very much about that.  There were a few people who said ‘you don’t understand Jim, we have an  opportunity to make 5%’. **But we were off by 2X, and we couldn’t catch up  \[going down that route\]. So I made this chart that summarised that our  plan was to** ***‘fall a little further behind Intel every year until we  died’*****.**  
&gt;  
&gt;With Zen, we were going to catch up in one generation. There were  three groups of people - a small group believed it (that Zen would catch  Intel in one generation); a medium-sized group of people that thought  if it happens, it would be cool; then another group that definitely  believed it was impossible. A lot of those people laughed, and some of  them kind of soldiered on, despite this belief. There was a lot of  cognitive dissoce, but I found all kinds of people that were really  enthusiastic.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mike Clark was the architect of Zen, and I made this list of things  we wanted to do \[for Zen\]. I said to Mike that if we did this it would  be great, so why don’t we do it? He said that AMD could do it. My  response was to ask why aren't we doing it - he said that everybody else  says it would be impossible. I took care of that part. It wasn’t just  me, there were lots of people involved in Zen, but it was also about  getting people out of the way that were blocking it. It was fun – as  I’ve said before, computer design needs to be fun. I try to get people  jazzed up about what we’re doing. I did all kinds of crazy stuff to get  people out of that kind of desultory hopelessness that they were falling  into. 

The part about his role at Intel was also interesting:

&gt;My team at Intel was 10,000 people, right, so you spend a lot of time  on organization charts and budgets, and all kinds of admin, and then  it's easy to find yourself just doing that and saying you’ll hand off  leadership for a project to this person or this person and that. But the  problem is there's so many things that are cross-functional – I want to  know what the fab is doing, how does the PDK work, how does the library  work, how does the IP team work, how does the SoC integration work, how  does the performance model work, how does the software work. Then you  find out that if you can't deep dive into all those pieces, bad things  happen.

I've noticed that sometimes my pc doesnt shut down so I'd press the exterior button on my pc to force shut down. next day I use it, PC notifies me that my amd driver ran into a problem but I never looked into it... Also noticed sometimes my pc doesnt sleep and stays on the whole night when not running anything but I think that stopped after I updated something/used NordVPN.

 

P.S. - Anyone use NordVPN and ever have your pc sleep and after waking up, your pc cant connect to the internet? My firefox just goes potato and stops responding even when I close thru ctrl+alt+del so I just have to restart my whole pc and reconnect on NordVPN.

Tomorrow me and my friend are going to build my new PC. The main parts are 5900x, MSI tomahawk x570, RTX 3070 and 2x16GB 3200 CL16 RAM. 

Now on the box of the motherboard there is the sticker that tells me the motherboard is compatible with ryzen 5xxx. Even though I still want to prepare an usb flash drive with the BIOS update (just in case it's not 5xxx ready)

I visited the MSI site to download the BIOS but the latest version is a beta version (7C84v163). Now I'm thinking whether I should go for this one or rather go for the older one which would be from 26.01.21 (7C84v15) or maybe even older one (7C84v14).

Also if it turns out that the motherboard is indeed compatible with ryzen 5xxx would it be safer to update BIOS via M-flash (in the BIOS interface) to a newer version or just use the FLASH back button?"

This does not make much sense to me. Why would it be limited to 64GB of memory?  
AMD's site spec's for the CPU does not mention any limit of 64GB.  


I have one of these and use it as a server with 64GB ECC 3200MT Kingston Server Premier in two modules. I am planning on adding 2 more for 128GB total. However, I am currently confused as to the conflicting information about the max amount of memory.  


One of the biggest thoughts popping into my head is ""why would AMD label something PRO but limit the amount of MEM?"" compared to regular ryzens? It is not like the iGPU steals memory lanes from the GPU...

Amd,calmblythe,82,1,"I can't decide on an air cooler for my 5800X!! Looking at ARCTIC, be quiet!, Noctua, and Scythe.I've been working on a build list for over a month now ([current iteration](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/user/calmblythe/saved/RGHjHx), [previous iteration](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/user/calmblythe/saved/2FnFsY)). Weeks ago, I settled on the NH-D15 (non-S), but, given the NH-D15S's price w/ no tax, I've started looking again.

It is _highly_ unlikely I'll overclock, or get anything more demanding/powerful than a 5800X for a while (unless I can get one for a steal).  

I'm not obsessed with having super-low temps. I think I'd be okay with it as long as it's not obviously… ""under-capable"", but I _would_ like an air cooler with: 

* some room to grow (could perhaps handle an OC'd 5800X or stock 5900X)
* good RAM clearance
* good value; defined as a balance between price, performance, and features

Bonus: Comes in Black or White, cuz I'm _somewhat_ going for a B&amp;W build.

I'm trying to decide between (prices in CAD):

* [ARCTIC Freezer 34 Esports Duo - White](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B0846LXCJ6/)
* [Noctua NH-D15S chromax.Black](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08HM1T6RL/) (makes more sense than the non-S right now, given price difference and RAM clearance)
* [Scythe Mugen 5 - Black Edition](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08X4HX858/) / [Scythe Mugen 5 Rev.B](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B06ZYB8K77/) (really not sure what Rev.B adds. They mention now offering full AM4 compatibility, but the non-Rev.B Mugen 5 mentions AM4 compatibility. Was AM4 compatibility lacking on the non-Rev.B?)
* [Scythe Fuma 2](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07QMK5R45/)
* [be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 4](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07BY6F8D9/)

Amd,JalYt_Justin,2,1,"RMA ExperienceI just went through the process to go through AMD RMA, and I just wanted to put my experience here for others.

Ever since I got my 5600X around Christmas time, I've had nothing but issues with it. Crashing, poor performance, you name it, I had it. It would *sometimes* work on default settings, doing anything with PBO was completely out of the question in lieu of crashing, and was overall not the greatest experience. It was very noticeably unstable and ran very hot and performed worse than nearly any other 5600X I had seen. Despite all the troubleshooting I did it never really seemed to improve, and thus I came to the conclusion that my CPU was defective.

So, RMA process. Overall it wasn't too hard to get all the information they needed, though I do wish that they had explicitly said EVERYTHING they wanted before I did anything. I had to clean and repaste my CPU twice, not just once, because they wanted a picture of the serial number on the CPU, and then wanted a picture of the same thing except with a paper handwritten note of the RMA service number for some reason. That was pretty annoying and I wish they explicitly stated they wanted that in the beginning, but otherwise not a big deal.

The whole shipping process, once my RMA got approved, took about 2 weeks. While this may not be fully under AMD's control, this, in my opinion, is FAR too long for an RMA process, especially compared to someone like EVGA who can get an RMA done in under a week easily. I can't imagine going through this if I had a lot of time-sensitive work that needed done.

But in the end, it actually ended out pretty good for me. The new 5600X I received not only runs cooler and performs better, but I can now also use CO/PBO without crashing! While I am still overall happy with the product I (eventually) received, I can't help but feel that AMD could be handling their shipping a lot better. I do work off my computer, and while it isn't necessarily time-sensitive, I potentially lost a lot of business being out a computer for 2 weeks. Despite that it's still an overall net positive from me.

Would love to know how other people's RMA experience went. :)"

I have continued looking for mini pc's, however the one I was aiming for is gone, the one with the ryzen 4500u, but I still want to know how the others ranked up to it.

I wanted to ask how each of these **Ryzen 7 3750h vs ryzen 4350g vs ryzen 4500u** ranks compared to each other in terms of both processing power, and graphics (seperatley? )

 ( I included ryzen 5 3550h just in case it is viable)

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I dont know if I am wrong, but as far as I can tell in terms of processing power it is:

1. Ryzen 5 4500u - 6 cores
2. ryzen 3 pro 4350g - 4 cores
3. ryzen 7 3750h - 4 cores
4. ryzen 7 3550h - 4 cores
5. ryzen 3 2200g - 4 cores ( old pc)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In terms of graphics I am not sure, since I am not sure if vega improved over generations or stayed the same.

but would the rankings be:

1. ryzen 3 pro 4350g - has vega 6?, 1700mhz, 6 graphics cores

2. ryzen 7  3750h - has vega 10, 1400mhz, 10 graphics core

3.ryzen 5 4500u - has vega 6? 1500mhz, 6 graphics cores

4. ryzen 5 3550h- has vega 8, 1200 mhz, 8 graphics cores

5.ryzen 3 2200g - vega 8, 1100mhz, 8 graphics cores  (old pc)

&amp;#x200B;

Judging by this I would expext ryzen 5 4500u to be the best in both processing and gpu, but since it not available, would ryzen 3 pro 4350g or ryzen 7 3750h be far behind?

I now play since 5 days with the new power supply and my 6900 XT and did not have any USB dropouts so far (knock on wood).

Amd,deorder,129,1,"USB even with the latest BIOS fix seems to still be fundamentally broken.After many days trying to fix my new AMD system I have come to the conclusion that the latest BIOS update that is supposed to fix the USB issues is just covering it up, but does not really fix it. I indeed do not get the mouse/keyboard freezes anymore every 2 seconds, but almost none of my USB devices connected through any USB hub (different brands) work where on my old system I had no issues.

Also when debugging USB in Linux (usbmon, wireshark usb sniffing) it is clear that things are dropping out.

I did set PCI-E to Gen3 and disabled the global C-state etc. Made sure all OCing is disabled and even tried underclocking.

What happens in my case:

- My G27 Logitech wheel is detected as a Driving Force wheel on all ports except one (the red 10Gb USB 3.2 one).

- Most devices connected via a hub do not work and I get a ""device descriptor read/64, error -32"" (Linux) / ""device descriptor request failed"" (Device Manager) error.

From what I've heard I am still the lucky one. This same setup worked 100% fine on my old Z170A Intel-based setup.

I am sad to acknowledge that I may have to return all components within the 2 week return window including the 5900x which I got for a good price. I have no time to first go through all kind of standard support steps of which most I've already done.
Building up the new PC and debugging all issues took me 3 days. I personally believe this is a fundamental AMD chipset issue and the latest BIOS update is just covering it up (it is just a matter of time until it causes other issues). From what I've learned from 2 different people, even a PCI-E USB extension card will still have this issue.

I really hope they can resolve this all as good competition against Intel is highly needed.

Anyone else still running into USB issues even with the latest BIOS that is supposed to fix this?"

I am on my 3rd Ryzen 5 3600 CPU. Each one ended it's runtime the same way.

Full Build will be corrected later today, but i don't know the correct names of everything.

CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600
Mainboard: MSI MAG B550M Mortar WiFi
    BIOS-Version: E7C94AMS.100
GPU: Powercolor Radeon RX 5700XT Red Dragon
RAM: 2*8GB DDR4 3600hz (i think g-skill but will have to check) in Ch2
PSU: 550W(Brand will be added once i am home later)
OS: Win10

Back to the Ryzen CPUs:
The first one held for about 16 Months but one day without any load to speak of the screens go dark and nothing else is working. After restarting fans a running, but no image appears. 
CPU LED is on.
I removed the CPU, installed it again, no change.
I exchanged the CPU for a Athlon 200g PC is booting again, but with no network capabilities. Since the CPU had bent pins(corrected) from a past accident, I thought this were the very late consequences, so i bought a new one.
The new one installed - everything is working again.
Barely 2 Months later the CPU died again without a lot of load, everything same as before. My Athlon Booted again but again without working network adapter. 
I RMA'ed it with AMD, they sent me a new one, everything  is fine AGAIN. That was 6 days ago, yesterday evening my PC died again. Again with the same issues. 
This time I didn't exchange the CPU again... I am just burned out from this. 

Does any of that sound familiar to anyone? 
What do you think i should do?"

Amd,hoxtoncolour,117,1,"I've just been having the worst time with Radeon 6800/XTThis is less of a troubleshooting thread and more of a general whine about my experience buying my first Team Red GPU.

Was on a Founders 1080 with zero problems. Despite the lack of stock I was lucky enough to snag an Asrock 6800 (Phantom Gaming) from Scan in January. Paid for it with my Christmas overtime. Card arrived and was crashing to a black screen with all lights still on. DDU'd everything no dice. Bought a new PSU still no dice. Late nights troubleshooting all week. Tried everything but it would crash immediately when entering games. Couldn't render videos for work except heavily underclocked and even then it was unstable.

Card ended up being DoA, something I'd never experienced before but hey. RMA'd it and retailer bumped me a 6800 XT because of stock issues and good will. It arrived and everything was great.

A month goes by and the 6800XT has been a champ. Been playing Cyberpunk 2077, Tarkov, Cloundpunk and Horizon Zero Dawn. Running amazingly. Great frame rates at great quality settings. But last Friday I tried to play CoD on stream but no dice. Streamlabs kept crashing all of a sudden and CoD would crash at launch. I saw there was a driver update that addressed Cod specifically, so I thought it might be worth disabling the driver auto update and get this one installed.

The driver update has since seriously broken everything. Card now is able to play high GPU usage games for about 20mins and then crashes. Streamlabs and OBS won't stay open for longer than half an hour whether it's doing anything or not. I've tried DDU to the new driver, nothing. I've tried DDU-ing to the previous driver I was on but it's still borked. The windows update I had tried to install in the hopes that would help, ended up breaking my windows install by making Windows Audio disappear and things stopped installing. Restore Point made it worse. Keyboard stopped working in Explorer, Start Menu and all Windows 10 themed dialogs.

I've backed up, formatted and installed a FRESH WINDOWS INSTALL LIKE THE ANNOYING, HALF ASSED PEOPLE ON FORUM THREADS ALWAYS SAY TO DO and it's still broken (saying nothing of the annoying Windows installation which decided to install the bootloader onto another hard drive completely). The same issues from my older windows install are here with the card but with a  different installation and software setup.

I've reseated and tested everything except trying to install the drivers sans Adrenaline but I've wasted my whole weekend at this point. RMA is possible but that comes with so much extra baggage regarding stock levels. I was excited to support AMD. I was excited to use open sourced drivers when I got my Linux drive set up. I was excited to stream and play games on AMD, but it's been so fraught with issues from day 1 and I find it difficult to choose Radeon in the future. I'm trying to think that maybe I'm just unlucky, that it's not a widespread problem but I don't know if I could put my mouth is on that one.

Thank you for reading if you've gotten this far. I've lost any will. I'm just working from MacBook for work in the time being and using my personal laptop to keep my Tarkov bitcoin running. I'm exhausted.

TL;DR: First time buying an AMD GPU. First one was DoA, second one was fine then has since been borked by a software update. All within three months."

Amd,thebigvoodoo,11,1,"Old-hand, Newbie needs helpHi, ya'll. Once upon a time, I was into overclocking, but this was back when that involved moving jumpers on motherboards and building watercoolers out of aquarium parts. I haven't kept up with computers for a while now, so I'm a bit rusty, to say the least. That being said, I have enough basic knowledge to navigate the terrain, and I've come up with a basic mid-range gaming computer which I plan to build myself. 

Would you guys mind looking it over to see if I'm not missing something basic? I'm unsure about ports, case sizes, RAM timings, and other compatibility issues. I intend to use this computer for streaming and media editing, with some gaming as well. Although I don't aim to overclock it initially, I want to have that option down the road once a.) I get comfortable with the subject again and b.) I'm playing a game worth overclocking for.

Here's what I've come up with:

* AMD 5600x
* be quiet! PURE BASE 500DX White Case
* ASUS TUF GAMING X570-PRO (WiFi 6) AMD AM4 (3rd Gen Ryzen) ATX Gaming Motherboard 
* GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 3060 Ti GAMING OC PRO Video Card
* Noctua NH-D15 SE-AM4 CPU Fan
* SAMSUNG 970 EVO Plus M.2 NVMe PCI-E 1TB Solid State Drive x2
* Seasonic FOCUS series SSR-750FM 750W 80 + Gold Semi-Modular Power Supply
* G.SKILL Trident Z Neo 16GB (2 x 8GB) 288-Pin RGB DDR4 3600 RAM

Since I'll be streaming, and because I'm just a peaceful dude, silence is really important to me, so if you have recommendations on anything I can swap out to make this thing quieter, I'm all ears (pun intended). I'm also open to hearing about recommendations for thermal compounds, cables, or anything else I might need to know in this new and exciting future I'm totally out of touch with.

And how in Daisy Chain the line connection from the cpu, goes to A1 and B1 of the Ram Configuration and then after it ""looks"" into A1 and B1 the connection will bounce to A2 and B2. It is important for the Ram to be in A2 and B2 because the connection from the CPU will always end in A2 and B2 and if nothing is there, the Frequency will bounce off the empy slot and potentially cause ""noise Interface"", that's why most Motherboard manufacturers instruct in the manual to place the ram in A2 and B2.   

The main thing that I took away in a Daisy Chain Configuration is that the memory controller from the CPU will go into A1 and B1, then go into A2 and B2. Thus having Ram in every single slot will actually gradually slow down the Ram/memory controller in the cpu, because it has a task to do in each dimm slot.  Since most motherboards have a Daisy Chain Configuration, it would be the most optimal to have 2 Ram Sticks.

I believe it's still more optimal to have 4 sticks of SINGLE RANK 8gb stick Versus 2 SINGLE RANK 8gb sticks.   But have 2 DOUBLE RANK sticks is the most optimal and have 4 DOUBLE RANK sticks of Ram will actually slightly slow down your ram in a Daisy Chain Ram Configuration.

I've personally always have not been super confident if you could have 4 sticks of Double Rank ram and this video really helped me And gave me a light bulb, so I thought I would share.

Then I downloaded AMD driver downloader tool from teihr website. Opened it and downloaded and installed the recommended driver. When the installation process reached 99%, my screen froze and the stuck-at-start up problem in the first paragraph happenrd again. 


So Now i uninstalled amd driver in safe mode. How to install conpatible AMD driver without crashing my PC? Please help. Me and my brother wanna play dota2


The versions of Intel and AMD drivers that my PC automatically installs are Intel HD graphics 4600 and AMD r5 M200."

Amd,Beaun11,10,1,"unexplainable temp spike in cinebench Ryzen 7 5800xHello all.....

&amp;#x200B;

I am a new (somewhat paranoid) owner of my first Ryzen build with a R7 5800x. I had downloaded Ryzen master to lower ppt, tdc, and edc values in the hopes of lower temps. I had run cinebench r23 prior to changes and been maxed out at 78-80C. After I did the adjustments (only lowered their values) nothing had really changed, so I reset everything back to default. When I went to run the program again, the temps jumped to 90C (reading from ryzen master as I had no other monitoring software running). I stopped the test after a few seconds maybe up to about 10-20 not really sure as it felt like an eternity and the temps fell. I reset everything again just to make sure and ran the test several times again. Each subsequent test, the temps maxed out around 79-80 again as they did originally.

&amp;#x200B;

first question is, is it possible I did any damage during the test that reached 90? It never went above 90, Ryzen master was just reading 90/90

If it is possible is there a way to diagnose any problem that might have occurred?

Is it possible that Ryzen master was getting an inaccurate reading as I was unable to replicate the condition again without changing settings to overclock (something I do not want to do)?

Amd,ChrisKeko,152,1,"Could trade my 3080 for a 6900XTHey guys, my situation is a little bit complicated. I really don’t know what to do.
So first of all, a friend of mine want to hop on the mining train.
He offered me his 6900XT reference design + 600€ which is barely a week old.
He would get my 3080 FTW3 which I payed 890€ last December.
On one hand I am fascinated about RT/DLSS.
Played Death Stranding with DLSS (wasn’t really necessary tbh) and played Control/Metro/2077 with RT.
But now there are almost no RT Games coming that im interested in.
Maybe BF6 but I don’t use RT in multiplayer games.
And RT implementation is really slow in my opinion.
The RT Games that I played are „old“ (Except 2077) and there are no Games with RT on the horizon.
And I think at the times where there are more RT Games, AMD could benefit with support because of the AMD GPUs in the new consoles.
On the other hand I’m not that guy that buy a new GPU every generation.
And this would be my first AMD GPU.
It would be nice to have a GPU for at least the RTX 7000/RX 8000 series.
Currently I’m playing in 3840x1600 Ultrawide, so I think That the extra VRAM would be nice to future proof.
My CPU is the Ryzen 7 5800X, so I could use SAM to boost my performance a little bit.
Is this trade worth it in my situation?"

im new to the AMD subreddit, and an AMD fanboy ever since i first built the AMD Dragon back in the late 2000s. unfortunately the 4870 x2 just recently started to fail on me where it wont install drivers (catalyst suite doesn't recognize there's a driver to be installed,) and the default windows driver artifacts in games i used to play perfectly at 1600x900

so i decided to build a new all AMD rig and spent the last week making parts lists, researching and whatnot, but it still seems i have a lot more to learn. i just recently learned about SAM where you have to pair a 5000 series cpu with a 6000 series gpu with a 500 series mobo. if i didnt learn about this sooner i might have spent money on a non-SAM pc build and it would have been a waste imo. i know about the requirements for pcie 4.0 as well, but learning about SAM makes me feel as if there are other AMD technologies i am missing out on a.k.a. secret sauce pairings

could you guys knowledge drop other AMD paired technologies and their requirements on a guy who hasn't built an AMD pc in over 10+ years? it's fairly important to me as i hope to be building my all AMD pc by the end of april. speaking of which, do you guys think it's worth building a pc right now, even all AMD? or should i wait till the end of september / december this year?

Amd,Smart-Yam9810,14,1,"Waterblocks for Smaller Reference Radeon RX 6800 PCB - Pulse 6800 - Fighter 6800 - Are any actually being created???I noticed Bykski had designed an A-RX6800-X waterblock on AliExpress, based around a smaller reference RX 6800 PCB, however when I ordered one I was sent the larger A-RX6900XT-X waterblock, which was for the larger stock reference boards (I was later told that the A-RX6800-X was only an illustration).

From my research online, the smaller reference Radeon RX 6800 PCB seems to be the basis for the Sapphire Pulse 6800 &amp; Powercolor Fighter 6800. I'm wondering in these crazy times of graphics cards, if anyone is actually doing waterblocks for these 6800 cards, that can occasionally be purchased, as opposed to the standard reference that have basically never existed in any reasonable numbers (at least here in Australia). 

These cards are faster than the geforce 2080ti and 3070 cards, and can sometimes compete with the 3080, and yet the slower, older 5700xt pulse seem to have plenty of waterblocks available.

I was originally hoping to buy a reference 6800xt, (which would have made the waterblock search easy), but could only find a Pulse 6800 for around the same price. Now 6700XT cards are even more expensive locally than both of their much faster stock siblings, were originally sold for.

If anyone has found a waterblock for the Sapphire Pulse 6800, would you please let me know?"

I rolled the drivers back to 20.12.1 and all the lost performance I managed to get back. I don't know if this is the place to post it but I figured it would get the attention of someone and maybe others can chime in about their experiences with vega 64 and the latest update (or a different card)

Core i5-7400
ASUS DUAL RX-480 4GB GPU

I've gone over some previous Reddit posts and YouTube videos regarding overclocking or undervolting however they are all on the old Wattman program, and a lot of the settings have changed on the new Radeon software. 

I was hoping someone could help me tweak my GPU the best way to make it the most efficient for FPS. 

I typically play first person shooters like warzone, CS go etc. War zone is nearly unplayable. Yet I've seen tons of people running the 480 on high settings. Any tips would be greatly appreciated."

Back in november 2020, I wanted to change my computer, but my budget was severely cut due to other issues. I ended up getting a b550m mobo ready for 5000 series, but I couldn't get any of the 5000 CPU because of the very high prices on reselling and no availabity in stores. I ended up getting a 3600X because it was the only CPU I could get at MSRP price, and my plan was to save and upgrade to a 5900X during 2021. But now I'm am afraid AMD will pass on restock Zen 3 and went straight to Zen 4, and I would be stuck on a dead-end system.

My problem is, even the 3600X is an upgrade over my previous CPU (i7 3770), I am looking to use it for core-hungry tasks like 3D software, Unreal Engine... A 8-12 core CPU is what I was looking for.

What are you views on this topic? Should I wait to get a 5000 series, or give up and keep my current build and get another one from scratch?

Only the Cinebench23 benchmark makes sense here as it is run as native app on M1. Gives a good idea about Tiger Lake vs M1 vs Ryzen 5000, though admittedly Ryzen is not running on the same power envelope.

Gist:

Single Core ---&gt; M1 = 1185G7 = 5980HS  
Multi Core ----&gt; 5980HS &gt; M1 &gt; 1185G7

AMD is the better option overall in terms of performance but M1 is the true technological marvel considering power consumption.

I'm in Europe and availability is not the issue for me and price difference between it and the 5600x is not that large, plus I actually do rendering, both for video and 3d modeling, so I would have a non-gaming use for it as well, but I am concerned about the 90 degrees.

I have an 5800x combined with a 3080, needless to say it's a mini nuclear factory.

My original cpu cooler was a Hyper 212 Black Edition which gave temps in the high 80s.

Ok then, I went and bought a Dark Rock Pro 4....but I was getting the same temps when I should be hovering around just 80c ish on full load. (???? wat)

Ok, added more case fans, still the same. At this point I am extremely confused.

When I hit 90c under just Cyberpunk I had an idea, I removed the side panel of my case.

And BEHOLD, temps dropped by 10c! So everything was around what it should be, cpu around 80c in Cyberpunk and my TUF OC 3080 just around 65c (instead of the 70-72c it produced).

When I put the side panel back on, temps creeped up slowly but surely to the same high ones.

I was extremely surprised my 4 case fans amounted to nothing and hot air was just chilling inside. For reference, my case is the Oberon Pro Silent (I should have known better going with a closed front case would be a disaster and I feel like such a noob when this isn't even my first system lol)

Lesson learned, I am now looking for the best airflow case with as much mesh as possible. It's just that I haven't been able to find one without a glass side panel.

Any recommendations?

Edit: Thanks for the suggestions everyone! I ended up ordering the recently released fractal Meshify 2 Compact (the Solid version because I didn't want a glass panel plus my build is not rgb anyway, it ticks all my other boxes as well, as for my old case, it will go to my dad's rig which has been using something extremely old and yellowed 15 year old case)"

Amd,minal187,16,2,"Ryzen 1700 in 2021 - hold or upgrade? where to go from here? (with 3080)Hello everyone, I'm looking to see if it's ""worth"" (I know that's subjective, but bear with me). upgrading my ryzen 1700. It's **currently** at base clock speeds with the stock Wraith Spire cooler (for some reason COD: Warzone doesn't play as friendly when I try to OC.)

**Specs**


I'm running the 1700 with a Sapphire Nitro+ 580x, but I have the ASUS TUF 3080 OC that I will be swapping. I'm also running 1440p/144hz with gysync/freesync (Asus TUF VG27AQ).

**Use case**

I do a fair amount of gaming, but also utilize the 8/16 for productivity. I know the 5600x/5900x is better value, but I'm going to keep it to 3700x/5800x for now. 

Ideally I can keep this computer for a couple more years. I'm running everything with a 750W 80+gold PSU and the ASROCK x370 Taichi.

1. My question is: should I upgrade the 1700? If yes, should I go for the 3700x or the 5800x?

2. Or, if no BIOS come out, is the 1700 --&gt; 3700x worth it for my case?

* I know the 5800x isn't officially supported, but ASROCK did release a beta BIOS, and I'm waiting to see if a stable version will be released or not. Assuming a stable version comes out, is that jump to the 5800x worth it?
* If I went with the 3700x I would MOST likely use the stock Wraith prism cooler. If the 5800x, I'd probably grab a Noctua DH-15 (which would up the cost more). For price context, the 3700x w/cooler is $440 CAD, whereas the 5800x w/noctua is approximately $800 CAD. If you consider taxes, that's essentially double the price.

As a side note: if anyone can give guidance as to why Warzone isn't OC friendly, or if I'm OC'ing it wrong, let me know)."

Amd,danieliskander,9,2,"Zen 3 dual/quad rank testingSo I finally got a gpu and completed my system. I ordered crucial ballistix 32gb 3600 rgb because I heard each stick was a DR 16gb stick. The memory I got was Micron B die but it was SR. So I ordered 4\*8gb instead and got Micron E die SR sticks so I thought I would test them against each other. I could not find much on Micron E die but ppl were saying they usually run a higher frequencies but worse timing. I am running both kits on 4000mhz 2000fclck at 16-18-18-38. The 4\*8gb kit seems more stable bc the 2\*16 B die crashed once on the first startup but that could have been a hiccup. (If anyone can clarify the difference between B and E die that would be appreciated)

So I tested them both against each other on SOTTR built in bench mark with my 5600x and 6900xt smart access memory on and rage mode on. The results were interesting, and it seems like the difference isn't as big as everyone originally made it out to be. Maybe this is due to bios/driver updates?

2\*16gb SR B die sticks:

So the quad rank got more fps as expected but only by 3/4 on avg of 3 runs. However it seems like the CPU render results on the 2\*16 kit are better than the 4\*8 kit. especially when looking at the maximum results. I looked it up and ppl were saying cpu game is the main thread and cpur render is all the other. threads but nots sure if that is true.

So is quad rank rly that much better than dual rank?

Earlier this year I bought a 3900x, kind of on a whim when my first big unemployment checks came in. I use my computer pretty much exclusively to game + school work, so the 12 cores are completely wasted on me. I managed to score a 5600x on Amazon for MSRP, which I know has stronger gaming performance than the 3900x. My question is, while I'm gaming are those extra cores being used to run the other programs I have open (spotify, hardware monitoring software, school documents, chrome tabs, etc.)? Will the 6 core 5600x be enough to game well with the extra stuff open, or should I return and try to get my hands on a 5800x?

First of all, fan settings have nothing to do with OC, second of all even if its a bad OC, it most likely will not crash at boot. Possibly only when you start gaming.

Amd,RoyalCatOnReddit,9,1,Amd Ryzen 3600 or 3700?Hi I am going for a new CPU and I was going for 3700 but I saw a guy that did a text about 3600 being for worth for gaming and that 3700 was a lil extra for his 3D stuff and all. I play games like CS:GO that even my cpu runs really well (Intel Core i5 7700) but I also play Destiny 2 and started playing Star Wars BattleFront II that my CPU doesn’t like that much. So yeah Im still at school so I don’t really wanna waste my money for a 3700 when 3600 would already be perfect. Thanks guys :3

Amd,CartographerGloomy41,2,1,"Wraith Prism is louder after upgrading my 2700x to a 5800x - why?So I upgraded my 2700x to the 5800x yesterday and I've noticed my Wraith Prism cooler is generally a bit louder than before. Whether idling, working, or gaming, it sounds about 20% louder than it used to and I'm wondering what the reason could be. Is the 5800X generally running hotter than the 2700x while performing the same tasks? I would think it would struggle less; right now at 10% usage it's at 40 Celcius and the fan is noticeably ""humming"". Motherboard is Aorus x470 Gaming Ultra with the updated BIOS (F60f).

I'm not sure if maybe I didn't apply the thermal paste correctly? I used Arctic Silver 5 and did the vertical line method as they advised for Ryzen CPUs. I ran Cinebench for about 5 minutes yesterday for the Multi-Core test and it reached about 55 Celcius which seemed well below the max, though the fan was noticeably loud (though not horribly loud). The L/H switch on the cooler is set to L so it should be running lower. Maybe I need to adjust the fan curve? Anything I could do in Ryzen Master? Is it just the break-in period?

As a side-note; when I was upgrading, the 2700x came out of the socket along with the cooler (as it was stuck to it). Not sure if this could have damaged the socket on the motherboard. Also, could this have caused any damage to the 2700x? The pins seem fine."

Not a surprise honestly, since I'm sure it's much more expensive to produce (180mm2 of TSMC N7 for 5000 series APU vs 80mm2 for Zen3 Desktop). But OEMs will be pushing AMD to produce as many as possible after investing in so many laptops designs with them. So the supply will likely still be a rung above the RX 6000 series supply, which should be completely dead for the foreseeable future."

I don't need a very good gpu (playing only csgo), a 1650 or a 2070 are enough, but i have to edit videos and photos so i need a good cpu and one with 8-cores. Touch is important because of school in this times and also in editing it will make it easier, but i can buy a lenovo m14t if it is not a convertible one. 

So i researched a lot and fall in love with the 4800h. Also the price will fall in few weeks so I can buy one for around 850€-900 i think.

The leaks about the 5th generation show that a 5700u or the 5800u will be near to the 4800h in multi-core, better in single core.

I'm currently rocking a Crosshair VII Hero, and while it added support for Ryzen 5000 the problems with the bios on this board are making me want to switch it up (not stable with memory OC like it was on previous revisions). 

The Gigabyte and MSI are both excellent at Memory OC, supposedly, and both have the same VRM controller except that MSI goes into extreme overkill with higher Amp powerstages which aren't really necessary. I do like the dual DIMM slots for better OC and the rear clear CMOS.

1. What version of bios do I need to upgrade to before using 3700x? Also since my BIOS is pretty old and I never upgraded it, can I just jump on the BIOS designed for 3700x or do I need to upgrade it in steps/series?
2. If I upgrade it to that bios, will I still be able to use my 2600 or do I have replace it with 3700x before I boot my PC?
3. What is the recommended ram for 3700x and this mobo?"
Amd,Gamingvirtual,3,1,Nzxt fan configHey everyone im getting an nzxt kraken x53 and tmrw and I dont know what I should do with my pc fans. I have a h510 and have put some intake fans in the front recently but have seen no change in temps. Also I spent a little extra to get the rgb nzxt fans for the aio. Im planning on having no intake fans and just making the front aio outake our maybe make the rear and top fan intake although it is not traditional.

Basically i never owned AMD and i'm interested in buying a 5800X, But there are barely any AMD motherboards available in my country.

&amp;nbsp;

**I'm planning on building a gaming PC for 2k/1080p gaming (No OC), With an RTX 3080 and 5800X or i7.
And i don't know if it matters but i want my ram to be able to run 3200mhz with OC and that the motherboard will support PCIE 4.0 (Future proof for GPU and SSD)**

**i've found like 3 that i'm interested in: (X570 latest and best chip?, Like Z490 for intel?)**

1) Asus ROG STRIX X570-F GAMING (3200mhz ram needs OC)

2) Asus PRIME X570-PRO (3200mhz ram no OC)

3) MSI MAG tomahawk Good reviews  but unavailable here).

&amp;nbsp;

I was this close to buying an i7 10700k cause it's much cheaper and it offers the same FPS, just takes more TDP.
BUT i found out the pos Z490 intel MB's don't support PCIE 4.0.
And also the 5800X costs like an i9 10900k, So i might wait and see what the new intel proccesors offer next month....



What do you suggest me to do?

Thanks!"
Amd,Ahoelinnone,2,1,"My first AMD build!So I decided in mid December to upgrade my i5-6600k (4.5ghz OC’d) to a Ryzen 7 5800x!

All my parts are scheduled to arrive on Thursday so I’m darn excited!

I’m going to reuse a few components I already have like the Noctua NH-D15, Corsair 750W PSU, fFractal Design R5 case,1080 ti card and my Samsung Evo Plus 2tb m.2.

New parts include 5800x, gigabyte aorus elite x570, g.skill 16gb ripjaw V.

I’ve become increasingly worried that my RAM sticks will cause issues due to the height collisioning with my cooler, but I’ll learn as I go!

Really looking forward to seeing the improvements the 5800x can give my PC!

Perhaps an AMD GPU next?"

Amd,IchEsseBabys,47,1,"Radeon RX 580 issues with blender, Cycles and Eevee Render EnginesHi. I recently started to learn blender, utilising my PC for something other than gaming. While I have had been very happy with my RX 580 for games, it has had nothing but issues in blender. 

First issue is the crash while rendering using the Cycles render engine (for the final render) which either resutls in a crash, a BSOD, or blender freezing. More details can be found in the link below:

https://developer.blender.org/T75319

Apparently the crashes were fixed for RDNA based hardware from driver 20.11 or forward, but it didn't change anything for GCN based GPUs, at least not for GCN 4.

Now, cycles crashing is fine, my GPU (RX 580 8GB) isn't that much, or at all, faster than rendering using cycles compared to my CPU (R5 2600), at least according to the benchmarks I've seen, so I can live with it. 

But the newest versions of the GPU drivers have also introduced a much bigger bug. Eevee rendering in viewport (or in general) turns everything grey. Just dark grey, nothing visible. You can see in the picture below:

[viewport in eevee rendering](https://i.imgur.com/zHVoBIB.png)

For comparison, here's the same scene with cycles:

[viewport in cycles rendering](https://i.imgur.com/Qa3alfA.png)

As you can clearly see, the eevee render scene is useless. Now you might say why don't I use cycles all the time; which I should say well because it's slow. Eevee is fast and useful for seeing how the shaders change on the fly. I can downgrade my dirvers probably, but I still do game, and doing so would mean I will have worse performace in Cyberpunk 2077.

Due to these problems with cycles and more recently eevee, I decided to look for an alternative render engine. Turns out AMD has their own render engine called [Radeon ProRender](https://radeon-pro.github.io/RadeonProRenderDocs/en/index.html). I installed it, and it is fine. Cycles is better, i.e, it has better end results, but RPR is not too bad and is much faster, it can also use both my CPU and GPU while rendering which makes it more efficient. 

Now, I was somewhat happy just working with RPR, at least till I get better with blender, but turns out there are issues here as well. 

First of all, almost all of blender tutorials on YouTube only cover cycles render engine. Which is fair, it's the one blender comes with. RPR does have decent documentional which has helped me create a few things I wanted (that acutally cycles didn't have any features for, go figure). But, it's still not as powerful as cycles, and I have still yet to figure out how to add an image texture to my materials in RPR.

The second issue rose when blender updated to version 2.91. Turns out RPR doesn't work with the new version at all. AMD has yet to update RPR with a compatible version for blender 2.91, so I had to revert back to blender 2.90.1.

All of these issues, have pretty much convinced me to never look at AMD again next time I'm upgrading my GPU. Not only they have ""worse"" features for use with something like blender, they often break whatever features they do have by frequently bad updates."

Amd,Xaymar,53,1,"The StreamFX AMD Encoder integration goes into round 2 of testing!Hey everyone, [maintainer of the StreamFX plugin for OBS Studio here!](https://github.com/Xaymar/obs-StreamFX/wiki) As you might remember, I've previously run a round of testing the AMD Encoder integration in StreamFX, [with varying success](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/i68rpl/the_obs_studio_plugin_streamfx_is_getting_amd_amf/). 

Many unexpected bugs were discovered, some that are caused by AMD still not having fixed their Driver, others caused by my own coding errors. Recently I had a bit of free time that I didn't spend playing World of Warcraft: Shadowlands, so I worked on the encoder integration again (and several other bugs that have confirmed fixes).

So once again, I'm reaching out to the AMD community to test, hopefully with better results than last time! With any luck, this will make it into the v0.10 release of the plugin, giving AMD users a zero-copy encoder in OBS Studio.

### Please make sure that you fulfill these requirements!
- Operating System: Windows 7, Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04 or newer, Debian 8 or newer
- OBS Studio: 26.0 or newer (no excuses!)
- Latest available AMD driver (again no excuses!)
- Latest available Chipset drivers (also no excuses!)

### Set OBS up the following way:
1. Create a new Profile with the ""Profile"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Advanced"" tab, set the following:
    - Process Priority: High
    - Color Format: NV12
    - Color Space: 709 or sRGB
    - Color Range: Partial
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Video"" tab, set the following:
    - Set Base and Output resolution to the same value.
    - Set Framerate to the framerate you want to record at.
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output""tab:
    - Set Output Mode to ""Advanced""
1. In the ""Settings""&gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Recording"" tab:
    - Change the encoder to ""AMD AMF H.264/AVC (via FFmpeg)"" or ""AMD AMF H.265/HEVC (via FFmpeg)""
    - Set ""Preset"" to ""Balanced""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Mode"" to ""Variable Bitrate (Peak Constrained)""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Look Ahead"" to ""Enabled""
    - Set ""Rate Control Options"" &gt; ""Frame Skipping"" to ""Disabled""
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Target Bitrate"" to ""25000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Maximum Bitrate"" to ""100000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Limits"" &gt; ""Buffer Size"" to ""50000"" kbit/s
    - Set ""Other Options"" &gt; ""VBAQ"" to ""Enabled""
    - Leave the rest at the default setting.
1. In the ""Settings"" &gt; ""Output"" &gt; ""Replay Buffer"" tab:
    - Check ""Enable Replay Buffer""
1. Done with the settings.
2. Create a new Scene Collection with the ""Scene Collection"" &gt; ""New"" menu option.
2. Add a single Game Capture source, make it fill the entire screen.
2. Done with the scene collection.
3. Windows only: Ensure that in any further OBS Studio runs, you have OBS Studio running as Administrator!
4. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, enable Game Mode to gain slightly improved performance.
5. Windows only: On Win10 2004 and up, you might gain additional performance by enabling ""Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling"" in the Graphics Settings of Windows.

### What needs testing?
1. Performance impact: How much impact does the new encoder have versus the currently included AMD Encoder in OBS Studio, or even compared to ReLive?
    1. Test a benchmark or game benchmark without any recording software running.
    2. Test the same benchmark/game with ReLive running.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
    3. Test the same benchmark/game with OBS Studio running and hooked into the game.
        1. Try recording with H.264
        2. and if possible also attempt the test with H.265
2. Quality differences:
    - Are there any non-encoder quality issues, such as corrupted frames or missing frames?
    - Does the footage play back without needing to be remuxed first?
3. File size: Our settings tell the AMD Encoder to at most produce 100mbit/s, does it actually respect this setting?

### What you shouldn't expect:
1. This has no effect on actual encoder quality, that is entirely in AMDs hands - they make the hardware, I only use it.
2. Performance will only be affected for encoding sessions, not for OBS Studio itself. Don't expect this to magically make OBS Studio faster."

I play warzone a lot, Mostly I would be getting 120-144fps but going into places with more textures and buildings like downtown and promenade It would dip to 100 and sometimes below it while playing at 1080p. All settings are low so I get the maximum fps. But when the fps drop close to 100 and under It just feels like I am running the game at 30 fps. Same with cold war, just in campaign with 1440p ultra settings, averaging 80-90fps the games feels like 30 fps. I can put everything to low and play at 1080p and hit 130fps+ for buttery smooth gameplay but thats not the problem. Problem is I can't seem to get that buttery smooth gameplay even averaging 90-100 fps in apex, warzone and coldwar. I have tried everything, turning off freesync makes it worse so i keep that on but turn off everything else on the radeon software. I know how 60fps+ gameplay looks like so I know theres something wrong. Every youtube video I have seen playing 60+ fps is soo much smoother than what gameplay I get at 90+"

I have searched and it seems that there has been similar issue even on Ryzen 3000 chips so im unsure if it is a hardware defect in the processor and as wondering if anybody has had similar issues and found a solution, i am wondering if it could be a potential driver or bios issue and will be solved with future updates or should i RMA my motherboard and CPU?

Amd,andrew8283,1,1,"Random GPU and Memory Clock Spikes?I have been noticing when I look in MSI Afterburner that I get these random spikes for my fan, memory, and GPU clocks. I believe the random spikes are causing these micro-black-screens, where the screen will flash black for a few seconds and then come back. This sometimes causes programs such as Minecraft to crash. Occasionally the frames drop and the game becomes more laggy and less responsive. Any ideas on how to fix this problem? 

I have tried updating the bios to the latest version because [pcpartpicker.com](https://pcpartpicker.com) said that may be an issue between the Ryzen processor and Motherboard. My drivers for everything seem to be up to date, I have also tried uninstalling Geforce Experience, reseating the graphics card, etc. Any help is appreciated.

I am toying with the idea of just getting an ROG Zenith Extreme II Alpha and dropping a 3960x into it. I like that I can load 128gb of RAM into it and upgrade to 256gb later. I want to use it for trading (stocks), gaming, content creation, and will likely use another PC to handle the streaming. Probably overkill, but is this a viable (albeit much more expensive) solution that will compete with Zen 3 architecture? Will I still get the advantages of having a 6900XT with a Threadripper as I would with a 5900x or 5950x? Also I might add another 6900XT down the road and will that work with Crossfire in any meaningful way? I know a bit, but this community has probably forgotten more about this than I'll ever be able to feasibly learn. I appreciate your opinions and feedback in advance."

Amd,razask007_ra,6,1,"Lenovo IdeaPad S540 13-inch: AMD Ryzen ensures a very good rating despite cut cornersWe have taken a look at the 13.3-inch subnotebook Lenovo IdeaPad S540. We were once again surprised by the currently outstanding performance of the Ryzen processors. Thanks to this, the laptop received a very good rating despite the manufacturer having cut a few cut corners.

The Lenovo IdeaPad S540 is a very performative office laptop with all-round potential and a price tag of 750 Euro (~$900) despite the manufacturer cutting one or two corners along the way.

We were somewhat annoyed by the display: While it certainly isn't bad, it can't keep up with the results of last year's panel. Contrast and the black value, for example, have become less good and even the brightness distribution isn't what it was. Presumably, Lenovo wanted to save a little money with the new panel. 

Another thing Lenovo was a little stingy about is the SSD: Although again this isn't a bad model, the Western Digital SSD can't quite keep up with the Samsung PM981 SSD in the device's predecessor.

Both these changes do not make the new S540 a bad laptop and the alternative hardware still is fine. Plus, the new IdeaPad 540 now features a new AMD Ryzen processor that is really impressive. The Ryzen 5 4600U in this device is almost twice as fast as the Ryzen 5 3550H in the predecessor. The Intel Core i5-1035G7 cannot even pretend to keep up with AMD's CPU.  

Find out whether the current 13.3-inch subnotebook powerhouse can iron out a large weakness the predecessor had and whether it is worth the money in our detailed review of the Lenovo IdeaPad S540-13ARE."

Step #1. If you can, get any model possible. If you want a GPU the fastest, you might have to settle for a terrible AIB card but look a card is a card. If you stick to only 1 model, stick to that model. Keep refreshing it whenever there is a guaranteed drop time.

Step #2. Setup an account on every store such as Amazon, BestBuy and Newegg etc. Setup Apple Pay if you have the capability. It is always the fastest on most stores such as Newegg. It’s a 1 click checkout option and works the best (That’s how I got my card). If you have a microcenter, go to that microcenter on their designated drop days. 

Step #3. Do not support scalpers. As much as they tempt you, DO NOT PAY OVER MSRP. When you buy something from them, it gives them more money to spend and keep scalping.

Step #4. Use other discord’s to help give you notifications. Make sure to have discord notifications get sent to your phone and use the mobile app for the fastest checkout.

Amd,Reddy23,9,1,"I can't recommend PLE Computers AustraliaI pray that PLE Computers Australia can't track my order, but this is why I'd never buy anything from them again. As a prelude I understand there isn't stock of anything everyone right now, specially the product which I have purchased.

&lt;rant&gt; 

I purchased a new Ryzen CPU on the launch date within the first two minutes. (I used multiple computers with the same account to get that small advantage in case one lagged). At the moment of purchase, I was given an ETA of about a week. Which I thought was very quick. 

Then upon checking daily on their website, I found out it date was changed to the week after.

Again, no big deal, there is a pandemic going on. I checked my email and received no correspondence (typical for PLE they expect that you check their website). 

So the date came around and I got ready to go pick it up, and just before leaving I checked their website and they had changed the date to the week after that, again in typical PLE fashion without email correspondence on the date.

Currently it has been 24 days after the launch and nearing a week after my last ETA, with no real reason as to why it took this long nor a reason why my 3 ETAs were not accurate. They promised thousands of units on launch day but I’m still unsure why I, as a customer, was treaded this badly. Am I overreacting and entitled? I mean I did spend a very large sum of money (for me) with them so :/

Without making identifying comments, this has happened to me before, for other products (that aren’t as popular), with PLE and their perpetual ETAs. I hope I get something at the end of this. Honestly they have the best excuse in the world to keep peoples money for an extended period of time to invest it or whatever. I'm having the year of my life :)

Amd,lexuz117,16,1,"RX 5700 XT worth it now?So looking to upgrade my graphics card but was wondering is it worth it to get the RX 5700 XT with the new RTX 30 series or the new RX 6000 series. 

Reason why I’m looking at the RX 5700 XT cuz in my country now it’s hard to get RTX 3070 due to lack of supply and price hike by 50% so the card is within my budget, looking for some experiences from those who have the card for a while and those who just bought it recently."
Amd,Defeqel,95,1,"FineWine and RipeGrapes, predicting the futureAmong all the launch topics, I thought it would be fun to start a speculative discussion on the benefits and demerits of RDNA2 and Ampere cards, and how they will age. I will just look at 6800 XT vs 3080 here, but the speculation probably scales.

# VRAM

There is an obvious difference between the cards in VRAM:

* RX 6800 XT - 16GB, 256-bit, 512GB/s
* RTX 3080    - 10GB, 320-bit, 760GB/s

There are currently only a few games which actually take a performance hit for going above 8GB of VRAM used, DOOM Eternal being one of those games, and this was also used by nVidia when marketing the 3080 through Digital Foundry. So how will VRAM usage change in the future?

The previous generation consoles launched with 8GB of shared RAM, of which 5GB was available for games, later PS4 Pro had 5.5GB available, while XBox One X had 9GB available to games. Consoles use shared memory, so it's not just the game assets, but also the game state which needs to fit on to that, but game state data is generally much smaller than assets like textures. The current/new generation consoles both have 16GB of shared RAM, of which around 13.5GB is available for games, for XSX 10GB of that is higher bandwidth meant for graphics.

A simple extrapolation would be ""consoles had 8GB, PC required 8GB, now console have 16GB, PC will require 16GB"", and I suspect long term that is accurate, but would a GPU from 2013 have benefited from 8GB of VRAM? R9 290X launched in 2013 with 4GB of VRAM, and the R9 390X launched with similar specifications, but 8GB of VRAM in 2015, on average there seems to be about [6%](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-r9-290x.c2460) performance difference between the cards (same is true for the non-X models). And taking a look at RX 480 [reviews](https://www.adtech.com/show/10446/the-amd-radeon-rx-480-preview/4) in 2016, the differences between the 4GB and 8GB models seem minimal, at least for 1080p and 1440p. I would argue that the previous generation experience suggests that games did not require even the 5GB that was available for consoles until there was enough GPU power to make use of that VRAM 3-4 years after the consoles launched.

**DirectStorage** is a new API and part of the DirectX suite of APIs, and provides direct access to high speed storage (NVMe SSDs) for GPUs. It allows the GPU to directly read and de-compress assets such as textures and geometry from storage to VRAM, without the need to first load them with the CPU to RAM and then transfer to VRAM. As Mark Cerny explains in the [Road to PS5](https://youtu.be/ph8LyNIT9sg?t=538) video, this allows the developers to better utilize the full amount RAM in the system, as less RAM needs to be dedicated as buffer for assets that may be needed. This would suggest that VRAM size requirements might even go down, but this is not the full story, PC games have long done that caching, at least part, in system RAM instead of VRAM, from where it is relatively quick to move data to VRAM, consoles do not have this option. Nevertheless I do expect a reduction in VRAM needs from DirectStorage, just not nearly as much as consoles will have.

**Mesh Shaders** is another addition to DirectX, and concerns handling of geometry (ie. triangles). It allows the developers to better cull the unneeded triangles, and vertices which make up the triangles, before further calculations are done on them (like texturing, lighting, etc.). This is already possible to large decree with the existing Compute shaders, but these are not part of the rendering pipeline, and require additional buffering of the triangle (vertex) data. Mesh shaders could help further save VRAM. Now conversely, Mesh shaders also allow much higher density geometry to be used in the game levels, which may increase size of geometry used in games as seen in [UE5 demo](https://youtu.be/qC5KtatMcUw?t=110), and the \~1B triangles mentioned in the video translate to 24 billion bytes (3 points per triangle, 3 axes per point, 4 bytes per coordinate on an axis, 3 \* 3 \* 4 \* 10\^9 bytes), or around 22GB, for just the geometry (although, they are probably using shared vertices and indices so actual size about 40% of that, still no idea how they got this to work on a PS5 with 16GB of total RAM).

**DirectX Raytracing (DXR)** is yet another addition to DirectX, and works by calculating ray intersections over the geometry / character models in the scene. Since calculating intersections between all the triangles which make up the geometry or character models is way too many calculations to be doing in real time, the scene is broken down to a simpler bounding volume hierarchy, which basically divides the geometry into boxes and inner boxes, since calculations on a fixed orientation box is simpler than for a triangle of arbitrary orientation. While this BVH isn't huge usually, it does take some VRAM space, and might need to increase in size if geometry increases.

# VRAM bandwidth and Infinity Cache

**A referesher on caches**

A cache is basically just a high bandwidth or low latency block of memory, sitting between a compute core and memory. In some ways every piece of memory between storage and a compute core (CPU, GPU) is cache. The idea being that since most data in memory is accessed more than once at a time, it is better to keep that data in as fast a memory as possible until it is no longer needed. For example, GPU textures when drawn on screen, very rarely map 1-to-1 to pixels on screen, that is to say, that one pixel (texel) in the texture would match one pixel on screen, and thus texels might be drawn on multiple pixels, or a single pixel might draw an average of multiple texels (meaning the next pixel will also use mostly the same texels for its average). GPUs already contain at least 2 levels of caches, which generally already cover our example, Infinity Cache is another level of cache.

The obvious limitation of Infinity Cache is the size, the obvious benefits are the bandwidth and latency, though hard numbers for just the cache are hard to come by. It's quite difficult to assess the impact of Infinity Cache.

**The benefits** over higher bandwidth VRAM for standard rendering seem negligible, outside cost and power savings, but it might prove an advantage for deep BVH structures as it is a rather large structure accessed quite frequently when traversed through. Deep (or deeper than current) BVH structures might become necessary if geometry increases in games (due to Mesh Shaders), but then again, that increased geometry also puts more strain on the cache and might result in the BVH structure getting pushed out of cache, negating much of the benefits. Similarly Mesh Shaders themselves might benefit as more data is accessed per shader there than the typical pipeline, though I do not know the specifics as I haven't played around with them, nor read the documentation. Some other shaders, compute especially, might also benefit if optimized for Infinity Cache, but I don't see why that would happen.

**The demerits** of Infinity Cache + lower bandwidth VRAM, are quite obvious, if more data is simultaneously used than can fit in the cache, then we are stuck at those lower bandwidth speeds, and a bit worse actually as the extra cache searches and misses provide a small penalty themselves. While RDNA2 performs worse than Ampere in current 4K titles on average, it doesn't seem to be an actual bandwidth limitation, or at least I haven't yet seen VRAM OC results which would prove otherwise.

# Compute

Just as obvious as the differences in VRAM is the difference in compute:

* RX 6800 XT - 20.7 TFLOPS, 4608 SPs
* RTX 3080    - 29.7 TFLOPS, 8704 CUDA cores

Then again, specs here are not the whole story, as Ampere uses a single floating point unit and one which can do either integer or floating point calculations. AMD uses a floating point unit and an integer unit per SP.

Also, [Ampere](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-3080.c3621) does not to provide double rate half precision calculations, unlike [RDNA2](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/radeon-rx-6800-xt.c3694), so FP16 TFLOPS would go:

* RX 6800 XT - 41.5 TFLOPS
* RTX 3080    - 29.7 TFLOPS

Now for both types of advantage, a lot depends on shader optimizations, as not all algorithms can be done in parallel, at least not all calculations, so that second FPU might go unused on the nVidia side, and conversely only a minority of algorithms can be converted to use lower precision, and it also depends on data layout, since if the data is fp32, but algorithm is done on fp16, just the data conversions might eat up any benefit gained. Here, nVidia has a solid history of a) driver shader optimizations, and b) sending engineers to optimize games and engines for their architectures.

For compute, I think we are already seeing the effects of the different architectures, as on lower resolutions, the higher frequencies of the 6800 XT allow it to cycle through more data and instructions per frame, while the 3080 is having trouble keeping its FPUs doing useful work. For 4K-like resolutions the 3080 gets an advantage as it can start flexing its higher compute.

Looking at how **Mesh Shaders** are affected by compute power is complicated. While Mesh shaders themselves might benefit from higher compute, it is likely the algorithms used there are not simple enough to parallelize as floating point calculations, and will also use integer calculations and branching when culling and transforming (this is all guess work, I have zero experience with Mesh shaders, and have read only a little of the documentation). As mentioned with VRAM, Mesh shaders allow for a much higher density geometry, and UE5 demo showed that the resulting triangles are often the size of a pixel or two, this has quite an effect on shader calculations down the line, as fragment shader operations on smaller triangles might not be able to keep the double FPUs of Ampere fed as well as the higher frequency single FPU on RDNA2.

As alluded to in the previous section on **DXR**, the increased geometry on future games might have an effect on how the BVH is structured, as a more geometry dense scene might benefit from a deeper BVH structure, to keep the majority of the calculations simple, the higher frequencies might be an advantage here especially if combined with fast and low latency data access, as provided by Infinity Cache. Once again, largely comes down to optimization.

# Ray tracing

Honestly, no idea. nVidia seems to have more custom hardware than AMD, though both do accelerate intersection calculations as I understand it. Currently nVidia has a clear advantage, but it is difficult to say why exactly that might be.

# Fill rates

* RX 6800 XT - 288.0 Gpixel/s, 648.0 Gtexel/s
* RTX 3080    - 164.2 Gpixel/s, 465.1 Gtexel/s

Unfortunately again, a topic I don't have much to say about. AMD has a clear advantage here, and bigger textures or an increase in frame buffers might give benefit for AMD in the future, but I haven't really come across situations with a fill rate bottleneck. Apparently AMD's RT calculations happen in TMUs however, so the advantage might not be as big as may first appear.

# Conclusions

As has been the case in the past, I expect nVidia's offerings to give a more even experience, while AMD is more likely to gain advantage some games, but perhaps with a bigger disadvantage in other games. I expect the 3080 VRAM to not be an issue until a more geometry dense approach to level design start getting common, and I would not expect that to happen within 3 years as developers get familiar with **Mesh Shaders** and engines like UE5 come out with features relying on it. I do not expect **DirectStorage** to alleviate VRAM requirements on PC and suspect its adoption might be quite low, apart from improved load times, the varied HW configurations on PC make it difficult to rely on it for game design. I suspect nVidia will continue to hold an advantage in **DXR** though it will be heavily game dependent.

I suspect the green grapes of nVidia to ripen in around 3 years, while a FineWine will require more than that."

Amd,Rafe-Q,488,1,"RX6000 Series Performance Analysis (official data)AMD just released their new rx6000 series graphic card with detailed performance figure on its website across 10 games on both 1440p and 4K. (test bench configuration and game setup included)

But not very intuitive and clear to see right?

So I grab their original JSON data file from the page source did some analysis

Conclusion:

At 2K, 6900 XT is about 7% faster than 3090, 6800 XT is slightly faster than 3090 (1.5%), 6800 XT is about 10% faster than 3080, 6800 is close to 3080 (5% slower), faster than 2080ti and 3070 about 20%.

At 4K, 6900 XT is about 3% faster compared to 3090, which we can say they are on par with each other. 6800 XT is about 5% slower than 3090, 6800 XT is about 5% faster than 3080, 6800 is about 15% faster than 2080 Ti and 3070.

All data from AMD official web, there is the possibility of AMD selection of their preferred games, but it is real data. 

My conclusion is that 6800 XT probably close to 3090, and 6800 is aimed at 3070ti/super. By the way, all the above tests have enabled AMD's smart access memory, but the rage mode has not been mentioned."

Hello subreddit,

I  have read the 3970x at 180 watt tdp instead of 280 watt tdp looses  about 10 percent performance while being some degrees cooler. This is  fine for me. I do care about power consumption and temperature. Lifetime  of the cpu is also important. Volume is not that important.

Can  the processor in eco mode be cooled reliably with air without  throttling or other disadvantages except the small performance loss ? I  am interested in 3d rendering where a rendering task can keep the cpu  busy for 1-2 days without a break. I am doubtful if air cooling 100%  workloads wich run over day and night is reliable. Cooling with water is  not an option for me.

Thanks for any insight."

Just for you guys, I shortened this a lot, in short term it is paying good, but in long term the investment will ve back in 7-10 years. Plus there is tons of sh*t you need to solve like any other business. Buying a commercial property isn't for everyone.

I saw a few Youtube videos where people were getting a 2200/3200g to boot on an asrock a520 so I was curious if you could go back even further

Turns out you can, but the default F2 bios with AGESA ComboV2 1.0.0.2  wont detect it

With Gigabytes latest release AMD AGESA ComboV2  F10 1.0.8.1 i was able to boot up and install windows, typing on it right now

I was about to give up until I opened up MC Extractor and saw 3 extra lines of Microcode that werent in the F2 version. I wouldnt think they would actually add old cpu support but they did

Low end board I know but I am sure this is probably possible on the Aurus B550 line as well as long as its AMD AGESA ComboV2 1.0.8.1 based"

Amd,nuharaf,8,1,"Why there are not lot more cheap a300 board ?There are bunch of $50 a320 micro-ATX motherboard, but there are no a300 micro-ATX. My logic say that it should be even cheaper (no chipset to purchase, less wire to route) than a320. It is true that going chipsetless give less IO, but does it matter for budget build ?

dGPU slot : going chipsetless dont affect this

SATA :   
Direct cpu provide 2 sata, a320 give 4 additional port. I feel 2 sata is enough for most budget built.

PCIe/NVMe:

Not using chipset mean 4 lanes pcie link is freed. I believe in Deskmini a300, chipset pcie link is routed to LAN and wifi.

USB:

direct cpu provide 4 usb 3.0, can use usb hub with benefit it can be sourced from multiple vendor (rather than single sourced from amd when using chipset). Deskmini actually has internal 4 port 2.0 hub  


My theory :

\- License fee to AMD making a300 not necessarily cheaper than a320"

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to share my results and experience I've got using CTR.

&amp;#x200B;

As you may notice previously I had 7422 pts in CB20 with the following settings:

// Vcore Normal

// Vcore offset -100mV

// LLC Auto

&amp;#x200B;

What I've learned (applicable to Gigabyte X570 mobo):

Despite recommended LLC setting is Turbo, I got Vdroop 0% and CTR recommending to decrease LLC.

They say LLC on Auto is fine as well, but in this case Vdroop is over 2% and CTR recommending to increase LLC.

Setting LLC to Medium is kinda a sweet spot. Vdroop is 1-1,5% and CTR recommending nothing in terms of LLC. :)

Following the results of DIAGNOSTIC I should have started with 4 350MHz and 1.250 mV as a reference values. But with these reference values my system ends up in BSOD almost immediately. I've decreased the frequency down to 4 200 MHz and the fine tuning finally started!

It took approximately 30-35 mins to finish.

The result in on the screenshot below.

&amp;#x200B;

Feel free to share your 3900X results here so we could compare whether this result is really good or just decent.

Amd,Soythony_Boythano,106,1,"PSA: there's a chance that the clocks CTR gives you aren't actually stable in heavier workloadsTesting each step of clocks for 240 seconds using Prime95 on three different FFT lengths as ClockTuner does on default settings isn't nearly enough to guarantee stability in heavy AVX workloads.

I ran some tests on my 3900X system. CTR gave me Cinebench clocks that were between 200 and 300MHz higher per core. I used a voltage of 1.25v, as CTR recommends by default. Vdroop was around 2.1-2.5%.



 | CCX1 | CCX2 | CCX3 | CCX4
---|---|----|----|----
Auto | 3969 | 3969 | 3969 | 3969
CTR | 4300 | 4275 | 4225 | 4250

Running an actually heavy stability test like Prime 95 small FFTs leads to an immediate bluescreen. Lowering each CCX with 25MHz still leads to tons of workers crashing after a couple of seconds.

**tl;dr**: The overclocks CTR provides you might be stable in lighter loads including games and shitposting on reddit, but they might not survive more rigorous stability testing. Always remember to perform thorough stability testing when overclocking, and this includes using different applications to test stability like for example OCCT or Realbench, not just one application on different settings. 

As always, you mileage will vary, and what I reported here might not be true in your case. But it's still on you to make sure your system is **actually stable**, and not place your faith in auto overclocking software that makes lavish promises that it might not be able to fulfill properly."

I however, haven't used an AMD card in a very long time so I would love to hear from others.

* TX550M Corsair 80+ gold PSU
* Sapphire RX 570 4gb 

**The Problem** 

I decided to swap out my stock Ryzen cooler with a tower air cooler (Deepcool Gammaxx GTE). Upon swapping coolers and installing some new fans, my pc all of a sudden gave no signal to my monitor. Gpu and case fans all spin. Gpu logo lights up, but fans do not light up. 

It was in use just hours before and had never shown any previous signs of failure. Now, when I power up the pc, the motherboard lights don’t turn on and my keyboard / mouse lights also do not turn on. I’m thinking maybe something happened and the board died? 

**What I’ve Tried** 

* Turning PSU off, holding power button down to discharge, and trying again. 

* Taking everything out of the case and bread boarding it, taking care to make sure all cables, RAM sticks, and gpu are properly connected. 

* Clearing cmos as well as disconnecting battery pin for about 2 minutes before reconnecting. 

* Inspecting cpu pins with phone light and magnifying glass. None seem to be bent. 

* Reseating all cables, cpu, gpu, and RAM sticks in different dimm combinations. 

* Reinstalling stock cooler (idk why but worth a shot). 

* Paperclip test on psu. Fan spins. 

Kind of at a loss here. It seems to me that the mobo somehow died which is super unfortunate seeing as I only wanted to replace the cooler. The cpu itself was not removed by means of sticking to the bottom of the cooler (had this happen to me on an old build) or manually removing it until AFTER I discovered the issue. Thought I’d ask here before I try an RMA or something. 

I live in Canada and don’t really trust Canada computers. My very first build had a similar issue which they diagnosed as a power supply problem. 3 years later I randomly decide to test it and it works fine. It’s since been sold though. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you all."

That battery life in a gaming laptop of this caliber is impressive to say the least.  The SSD is noticeably snappy and the 120hz display makes everything more fluid and enjoyable.  RTX graphics makes this laptop capable of playing any title and utilizing the latest graphics technology.  If you're in the market for a laptop for editing on the go, or RTX Minecraft between your CS classes, this is a strong option if you're wiling to fork out the money.  I got mine for $1,349.99 and compared to other laptops around this price point, the hardware value is hard to match if you're looking for raw performance.  Is has battery life over gaming laptops, and processing power over premium options like the MBP and Dell XPS lineup.  I definitely recommend this laptop.  Let me know what you think of this laptop and this fantastic CPU!"

Amd,neuncs,2,1,"Asus TUF B550 Gaming Plus - an overclocking + undervolting beast?I mean I buit this PC a week ago and have been looking for more performance and usually lower temps and decided to give Ryzen Master a try... 

AMD has a problem where their CPUs are constantly running at max boost clock (which is 4.2 Ghz on all cores and up to 1.4V \[Stats from HWinfo64\] for the 3700X I believe), but I'm not sure if it's a thing with other AMD CPUs or that it's only a ""3700X problem"". 

So back to the main thing I wanted to talk about here... Is this OC even okay to do? Or can it affect my PCs performance over the years? I ran Cinebench R20 a few times. Increased performance from stock to about 4800+ which is 400 points above what I had before. It's completely stable and everything, I just wanted to ask any overclocking ""professionalist"" what they think about this OC+ Underclock and what I could do better. 

Thanks to everyone who took their time to read this.

Amd,LateNightSalami,3,1,"Intel Burn Test and stability testing with 3900xHi all, I am new to overclocking/tweaking so I am learning at I go. My base setup:

CPU: 3900x

GPU: 1080ti sc black

MOBO: C8H

RAM: 32 GB 3600 cl17-18-18-18

Cooling: open loop with 3 240 rads, both CPU and GPU are on the same loop

PSU: thermaltake toughpower grand rgb 850

Tweaks:

RAM AND IF: I tweaked the RAM UP to 3733 and have it at 1.39V (it might go lower voltage wise but this seemed to boot well so I can play with it more later). I then set the fclk to 1867 to couple it with the RAM speed

CPU: I turned PBO on with a 5x scalar, set 200mHz offset

Characteristics of tweaks: It gamed while streaming 1080p 60 fps for a few hours the other night with no hitches. Right now cinebench score is about 7230 or so with chrome open and lot of apps like discord running in the background (not great but not terrible, I will figure out how to shut down all background apps for a more reliable score soon). It passes intel burn test on High, but only hit 9 outputs on very high and 2 on maximum. My peak single core clock seems just shy of 4.4 GHz, I have never seen a single core reach 4.6. I am currently running prime95 large fft to test that the memory overclock is stable.

Main questions:

How to get better single core clocks? Not that the CPU is performing particularly bad per se but it would be nice to actually see 4.6 at some point.

Intel Burn test does not crash and temps never exceeds 75 deg (Ryzen master) but it still says system not stable at max and very high. I don't think it is cooling. Would fclk cause this? Anything I can do to improve stability?

Is there a direct test to ensure fclk is stable?

Amd,Josephthe3G,5,1,"Short-term review of the Yoga Slim 7 

I got a SKU with a 4500U, 8 GB of RAM and a 512 GB SSD. The machine feels and looks great, not super premium but definitely above its price. Display looks beautiful even though it's matte but the lower bezel could be smaller.

**Display**

As noted this is a matte display so reflections are almost non-existent. However, the 300 nit brightness leaves a lot to be desired in anything less than 90% brightness, the single biggest flaw on the machine. Colors look great though and viewing angles are what you'd expect from an IPS at this price.

**Performance**

The 4500U is a powerhouse for the TDP at 25W even without SMT. It's way too snappy for most of the things I do as a law student such as web browsing, doc writing and media consumption. However, when I want to use that 4 GHz boost it's reliable and seamless. For anyone interested, it scored a 2387 in Cinebench R20, an impressive score for a slim 25W ultrabook. Memory is fast but I really do not recommend 8 GB anymore as Windows takes a heavy chunk of that even when disabling non-critical processes.

As for the integrated graphics, I tried two titles which aren't the most demanding out there. Medieval Total War 2 got me a solid 60+ FPS at highest settings but I locked it (insert The Verge reference here) to keep temps lower. Also tried GTA V on High/medium and got about 45 FPS which was definitely playable but not that nice to watch. Now as far as temps are concerned, it's a mixed bag. The CPU package skyrockets to 101 degrees when gaming without fps limiters on and during more demanding titles. Fans kick in a bit too late but afterward they can keep the package at about 80 degrees and lower long term which I find acceptable for such a slim machine.

**Keyboard and touchpad**

Now coming from a 15,6 Acer thiccboi I was used to a hefty amount of real estate. Keys feel good to click but are shallow as you would expect. It does feel kind of cramped for an average sized male but you get used to it. Some key placements are quite annoying but this is also a Scandinavian keyboard which adds three letters. Caps lock button is way too big and up-and-down keys are way too small, love the FN keys for their utility though. Keyboard backlight has 3 levels but the lit options look the same and it does get bright.

Touchpad has an acceptable size for the form factor and feels smooth and every gesture works as you'd want, not much to add here.

**Battery Life**

The battery life has impressed me. The 61 Wh cell is decently sized and I've got about 10 hours of active use. This is mostly with full brightness and keyboard lighting off but with the power slider at the second option and Lenovo's Intelligent cooling. My rationale is that the CPU is fast enough to be run at low wattage and clocks, especially for most of my use cases.

**Other aspects**

Sound is great with the two front-firing speakers, a joy while streaming music or videos. The Windows Hello IR is good but not as reliable as a fingerprint reader and the web camera itself is average. Temps and fans during light usage are great pros of the device, temps are low at about 45 degrees and fans are completely quiet. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are extremely solid with the Wi-Fi 6 Intel chip, no issues encountered whatsoever.

**Conclusion**

I love this machine and its value proposition which is a lot better compared to the usual Macbook Air students like to pick up here in Sweden (dual core in 2020, come on). Build, performance and battery life are the biggest pros while the biggest con is by far the low display brightness. Lenovo doesn't really seem to be offering a 400-nit option and it is usually non-configurable at their website which means it's the best AMD got this time around. The memory works fine but capacity was lackluster, something which is of course due to the SKU.

All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who doesn't really need discrete graphics and the fastest and most powerful CPU even though you can get your hands on an 8-core 4800U SKU if you're lucky."

Helping a friend fix their computer where one day it wouldn't show a picture but seemed like it would boot.  Basically troubleshot it down to likely being bad PCIe slot on the motherboard or a PSU because both of the GPUs they have boot on slot 2. I thought a CPU issue might be possible but unlikely.


Fast forward, they ordered a new Motherboard and PSU just in case..  During using the old motherboard with the old PSU they would see some random power flickers of all their components but it would all come back up. Strange but kinda further pushed the idea of it being a board issue.

So they moved their 3900x to a new board with a new PSU and after finally getting it to attempt to boot, the first 16x slot did the same thing as the first board.  Works fine in the second slot but the first one has no picture.  Anybody here have this experience before?"

So while some might be disappointed that RDNA2 isn't the halo product of the upcoming generation, there is hope that the one after might be where AMD retakes the crown.

Assuming Nvidia doesn't sink gazillions into a hail Mary. Which they probably will do.

But what AMD is doing, I think, is remarkable."

I have the viotek gft27db which is gsync compatible with a gtx 1080 in my computer. I have freesync turned on in the monitor settings and have gsync compatible turned on in nvidia control panel as well.

I'm pretty sure its working? I do notice what looks like light tearing though and have thought about maybe selling my 1080 and getting a 5700 or something if it would work better with a freesync monitor.

I also think its working because when i go into monitor settings it shows the refresh rate as the current frame rate when i opened the menu suggesting that the refresh rate is changing in pace with the frame rate.

I could also try and sell my monitor and get one with a gsync module but that may be a lot more expensive. Any advice/help is appreciated."

Got 4565 points maximum and the usual score for this CPU is between 4800-4900 right? I don't know if my other components or my BIOS config are having anything to do with it:

* Mobo: Asus Prime X570-P
* Ram: Crucial Ballistix sport LT 16GB 3000MHz cl 16
* GPU: GTX 1060 6GB Zotac Mini
* PSU: Thermaltake Smart 550w 80+ Bronze

My CPU has an Arctic Freezer 33 eSport edition for cooling and never peaks above 70C on this test.

In the BIOS, XMP is enabled FCLK 1500MHz, PBO auto, Tried messing with the RAM timings using the safe profile from 1usmus tool but ended up having a mobo not being able to post so had to reset it and never touched those values again. This 3700x has to be one of the first batches since I got it in august 2019 as far as I remember.

I'm not sure if this score can represent a noticeable downgrade in performance in other aspects like games or Blender so I wanna ask you if this score is expected for my case or something is wrong with the CPU.

Thanks in advance"

A few months ago I moved amd ryzen and love it, and it's been solid and a nice upgrade over my old 6700k system.today I updated the bios of my motherboard ( ASUS crosshair 7 hero) and when I was setting up the bios after the update, I came across the GPU info and it said it was running at x8 rather than 16. After some research I found out that using the top slot of the mobo for an nvme, it takes up some lanes and makes it run at x8. Would my nvmes speeds be any different etc if I installed it to the bottom slot? I want to enable x16 on my gpu after months not realising it was in that mode!"

This happened with my kovaak's aim trainer as well. If someone else is also experiencing this thing here's a fix that may work

1.  Change the resolution to a lower one (never the higher one)
2. Go back and check if the display is stable now or not. 
3. If the display is stable , you can change it back to the resolution and the frame rate will stay the same

4. If the display doesn't become stable , trying lowering the resolution for the second time to even lower resolution.

Amd,abstart,0,1,"3700x no longer hitting max boost on any coreI've had a 3700x for about 6 months. Windows 10 x64. During initial setup I enabled XMP, tuned my ram timing, installed AMD chipset drivers and set AMD balanced plan. PBO off.

I have not made any system changes since initial setup other than regular windows updates. I have not installed the May 2020 2004 update yet. No chipset update, no bios update, etc.

After initial setup I regularly saw single core boost hitting 4.4 ghz on 3 out of 8 cores, and 4.375 on another 3. Now I'm not seeing *any* core hit higher than 4.36 (5 cores hitting that speed). Benches also show a small drop in performance. E.g. cinebench r20 was around 3800-3850 for me after initial setup, and now is in the 3650 range.

Although it is summer now, I have AC and temps are about the same (e.g. my hwinfo currently has a max of 60 celcius. I've seen up to 70 c in cinebench r20.

When I activate the XMP or enter the frequency, timings and voltage of the RAM manually I have a display problem only when I reboot via the BIOS and Windows, all my peripherals and my PC are running correctly, only the display is not working, the screen is off and when I turn it on it tells me that there is no signal, but if I reboot via the reset button of my box, everything works.

If I leave settings by default, everything works correctly, the reboot via BIOS and Windows are ok, that seems to be a problem with the FCLK,

Amd,Star_Pilgrim,0,1,"Can't boot into BIOS and resetting jumper or removing the battery does nothingAfter reading a plethora of various forums and watching a ton of ""This method 100% works"" YouTube videos, I am at a crossroads where I must admit that lifting my arms feels the only course of action I can take.

But I turn to the magic of Reddit, because there is always at least one PRO lurking about.

Turning to Asus support was a farce to say the least. Boilerplate copy/paste responses and stupid recommendations even a grandma would have tried beforehand turning to them for support.

&amp;#x200B;

**System:**

* Pro WS X570-ACE  (Version 2010 BIOS recently updated)
* AMD 3900X
* CAPTAIN 240PRO V2 cooler
* EVGA 1000W SuperNova G3
* Gigabyte 2080 Super Gaming OC
* 64 Gb of 3600 CL16 ram (F4-3600C16Q-64GTZR)
* Intel Optane 900P 480 Gb
* Samsung 870 EVO
* 2 HDDs

&amp;#x200B;

**The problem:**

Computer boots straight into Windows 10 Pro, and no matter what I do, I cannot get it to boot into BIOS.

**""Solutions"" I have tried:**

* Resetting the BIOS jumper (RTC CLR),... standard procedure (yes ofc with power unplugged)
* Unplugging every device, cable, disks,memory.. EVERYTHING, and the battery for 30 minutes while pressing power button and chanting into the moon.
* Trying to enter UEFI setup from Windows (yeah all the ways) Result is black screen and then boot back into windows.
* Disabling Fast Boot has no effect
* Desktop application from ASUS that should supposedly take me straight into BIOS has no effect.
* Trying an enormous number of versions of various BIOS tools like AFUWIN64, flashbios tools for Linux (ubuntu), even EFI ones without success (always said that either ROM image is the wrong size or something of the other. Converting CAP into ROM with UEFITool.... the whole tutorials already tried.
* Creating various UEFI boot USBs to boot from, and following some suggestions with the tools to flash bios or clear NVRAM at least has no effect.
* Using EZ Update in AI Suite 3 in order to update to the new bios, reboots my PC and it makes 2 beeps, which are an  ASUS CrashFree BIOS 3  notification that it recognized a BIOS file. It does NOT. Boots straight into Windows.
* Hell, I even tried some MSI and Gigabyte BIOS utilities.

&amp;#x200B;

**What I am apparently limited to:**

* Virtualization is disabled in BIOS (so no AFUDOS trickery or any other such thing)
* I am strictly limited to any and all UEFI booting.
* NOTHING Legacy. Can't boot into FreeDOS, MS-DOS or any of that. :/ I think If I could somehow boot into DOS (legacy mode), AFUDOS would work.
* Whenever I am close to flashing the bios it tells me the ROM size is not correct (yes I have tried AFU tool version with /GAN support,.. does not work), BIOS does not support AFU.

&amp;#x200B;

Most others on the forums who seem to have this issue, whether they own MSI, Gigabyte or other boards, seem to have solved their issues, since those tools worked for them.

Very rare condition this, and in my 30 years of computer use and bios flashing, I have never seen anything like it.

&amp;#x200B;

SO if you have some tricks up your sleeve, or you know a forum I should turn to, please post a link or a suggestion.

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you."

So just today I upgraded from R5 1600 no R5 3600X (Yay!), which i can really notice while gaming (I cant finally make full use of my 144hz monitor for CSGO and probably Valorant when it comes out)... The thing is, since i mounted the CPU (And the cooler) i was testing the CPU with 3D Mark and MSI Afterburner for signs that i might've done it wrong, but since i dont know what the CPU should usually report, i dont know if thats the case.

So while running Time Spy, at the CPU Test the Temps on MSI Afterburner ranged from 65º C to 80º C at one point.

Then later i was playing CSGO with a friend of mine, and having the OnScreen Monitoring i noticed my temperatures being around 72 to 78 degrees, and it got me a little worried. Like, i dont know if thats normal, i've read online that i shouldnt go over 85º but 79º seems a bit too close for comfort...

Also, i've read that Ryzen CPUs with the X have a 20º offset when reporting to third party monitoring apps, but i dont know if that's the case. Would Afterburner be showing the incorrect temperatures maybe? I downloaded AMD Ryzen Master and the idle temperature right now (Browsing) is 46º, is that the right temperature? I would assume the actual Ryzen software would show the actual temperature of the CPU right? I dont know how accurate it is compared to Afterburner.

Any help please? I dont wanna ruin my new CPU."

Amd,Mistikman,12,1,"Did I manage to pull a ridiculously stable 3900X?I am building an new computer in a very small case which will require a lot to keep the thermals in control.

Prior to putting the computer in said case, I am trying to figure out the limits of my processor in terms of voltage to get it to run as cool as  possible.

I came across the following article:  https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/ryzen-9-3900x-overclock#:~:text=The%20Ryzen%209%203900X%20is,CPU%20lifespan%20affirming%2C%201.250v. 

That seems to state that only 6% of 3900X CPUs are stable at 4200 across all cores while running at 1.25v (stock is 1.4v)

I am using Ryzen Master to see how low I can get the voltage at 4.2ghz on call cores, and I seem to still be stable at 1.15v, and I might be able to go lower. Am I doing something wrong, or did I just get absurdly lucky with a process that's even better than the 6% they identified?

Amd,Luffy71,11,1,"Latest AMD graphics Drivers makes my GPU burnHey guys, I would kindly ask if someone else has experienced this.
Since last driver update my Sapphire Pulse RX5700XT runs hot af.
My max actual Temps with the drivers before were about 77°C and junction Temps about 80°C on 100% load.
I just installed drivers as usual without hesitating. I do read everytime the changelog just to see if something in my interest changes. Nothing special.
Then after playing about 30 min COD Warzone my pc just shut off (screen went black but all the hardware and led's Wer still on). I had to press the shut down button so long till my pc runs completely off. After that, the same happened again while playing. I didn't think that it would be the thermals since I didn't have any problems with it before. But I got suspicious.
So I checked the thermals while gaming the 3rd time. What I recognized was that my actual Temp was 83°C and the junction Temp at 95°C. My custom fan curve were also set to default. 
The only thing I could do was to set the max frequency of my Gpu to - 5% (my Gpu wasn't overclcoked before, since I didn't see a reason to overclock it). Now I can play like that but the Temps are still higher than it was before the latest driver.

Amd,StanDough,10,1,"Can the B350m MORTAR Achieve 3200MHz RAM Speeds with 1500x?Hello! My PC currently has 8GB of RAM (G.SKILL TRIDENT Z rated at 3200MHz). I have the B350m MORTAR and a 1500x. However, I can only run my RAM kit at XMP 1 which is 2933MHz. If I try XMP 2, at 3200MHz, my PC randomly BSODs from time to time... even though my current RAM kit is rated for that speed.


I attributed this to the RAM kit not being on MSI's QVL list.


Now, I'm looking to upgrade to 16GB of RAM. I found [this kit](https://www.amazon.com/G-SKILL-Ripjaws-PC4-25600-3200MHz-F4-3200C16D-16GVKB/dp/B015FXXBW0) that is on my motherboard's QVL list. It's the G.SKILL 16GB (2 x 8GB) Ripjaws V Series DDR4 3200MHz F4-3200C16D-16GVKB


On paper, I SHOULD be able to achieve stable 3200MHz. However, I've seen posts with this same RAM kit and that they're not getting the same dies as advertised, or that they're not actually reaching 3200MHz. 


Should I still push through with this purchase? Can my setup even run stable 3200MHz? Should I just settle for 2933MHz but better quality RAM since most games nowadays benefit from better RAM in general? 


Or for those who've been in my exact situation, what RAM kit worked for you? timings? voltage? etc."

Amd,ItsDawn_,0,1,"Need HelpI just bought a new graphics card (RX5500-XT), and windows doesn't recognize it; When I check my display adapter is doesn't say RX5500, it says ""microsoft basic display driver"".

2 days ago when i bought it, it worked fine apart from not getting recognized by windows, but now it doesn't even get 10 fps on most games. I have no idea what could've caused this.

My specs:

Processor: Intel i5-6600 CPU 

RAM: 16

Amd,PM5k,16,1,"5700xt advice needed as I’m considering buying it.My 2070s died on me after 2 months of use, and I’m due a refund on it. This leaves me with two budget brackets - £500 which is the refund amount. And £600 which is budget at a push, but with some caveats explained below. 

I initially wanted to re-purchase a 2070 super. But for that I was eyeing up the MSI Gaming X Trio, which is around £590. Then I thought to myself that surely AMD do a competing card on a budget and found that there’s some really good stuff being said about the 5700xt’s and those barely hit the £400 mark. I did some YouTube searching and saw some 4K/1440p runs of games like RDR2 and AC:Odyssey and the frame rate differences were marginal between a 2070s and 5700xt. 

Now it’s also important I mention that I make heavy use of the NVENC functionality, but I can temporarily live without it.

So I’m just wondering - with the impending launch of NVIDIA’s 3000 line, does it make sense to go for a 2070s or should I temporarily switch over to a 5700xt and how good are they really? I don’t know which third part manufacturer makes the best XTs although I saw people mentioning the red dragon version of it. What do you guys think about this? If I eventually wanted to grab the 3K series, would the XT be a good temporary measure for pseudo 4K gaming for me or should I just go back to RTX? 

I know this is an AMD sub, but I reckon I can get some honest advice without any fanboy bias. Thank you so much in advance."

Something interesting to note here, is that on the Intel version they did put Max-Q in the specs, but not on the AMD version. So that definitely gives us hope (if not confirm) that the 1660 Ti/RTX 2060 on the 4800H models are non-Max-Q, besides their ""OmenTempest Cooling"" marketing.

Also the June 16th shipping date indicates that it might release today or very soon this week."

I have a Ryzen 5 3600 that I started using with the stock cooler. I ended up upgrading the cooler to the Wraith Prism, but after installing noticed that it was very loud. The best way to describe it is as if the fan was revving, like got super loud randomly, then calmed down, repeat. Also noticed that CPU temps were kinda high, which I assumed is what caused the fans to spin super fast. 
I googled the problem but only happened to find 1 solution from a YouTube video, which happened to be lowering minimum/maximum processor state numbers. It immediately fixed the issue. Does this impact performance? If so, what is a better way to fix the fan issue?

Would love some thoughts on my slightly reworked budget build, to be used for some light 1080p gaming and daily computer tasks, like browsing the web and running a small Plex server. I'm not looking to play the newest AAA games, and would like to be able to use this for daily tasks for some time.

I was originally going to go with the Ryzen 3 3300X, but I want to build within the next two weeks and it looks like those won't be shipping for some time. Switching to the 1600AF and grabbing lower RAM speed (from 3600 to 3200) also allowed me to switch from a 2.5 SSD to a M.2, which I read will be faster and easier to install. I have tons of external drives for storage.

I'm planning on building on 6/14. I figured if the 3300X does actually get released by then, I can grab one at Microcenter and return the 1600AF I bought. I still have the 3600 RAM that I haven't returned yet, so I can use that as well. But realistically, I think it's going to be delayed/backordered for a very long time.

Anything stand out that you would change? Is the compatibility notes on PCPM anything to worry about?"

First upgrade window to actual version and do clean setup new chipset and video driver. Go to Clear CMOS and set all to default after reboot, save. After this one i go to Ryzen Master  [https://www.amd.com/ru/technologies/ryzen-master](https://www.amd.com/ru/technologies/ryzen-master) . I have a lil problen with my memory XMP, profile set that Command Rate on 2T, so i switch manually to 1T and set other timings from HOME page in Ryzen Master. Honestly think only i have issue some like dat dont know.

Amd,Hyliian_,0,1,"AMD Wraith Stealth (Ryzen 2200G) size vs. AMD Wraith Prism RGB (Ryzen 7 3800X) sizeHey r/Amd,  


Almost two years ago now, I purchased a Ryzen 3 2200G for my first PC build - and it's served me beautifully until now. I am finally in a position to upgrade, especially now that I have a GPU (I initially bought the 2200G because I couldn't afford a GPU, and it had integrated graphics). I want to purchase either a Ryzen 7 3700X or 3800X, both coming in-box with the Wraith Prism RGB CPU cooler - whereas the 2200G came with the Wraith Stealth CPU cooler. When I built my PC, and installed the Wraith Stealth, it BARELY had enough room but ended up fitting in my motherboard (almost bumps into the ram I installed). My motherboard is the MSI B450M GAMING PLUS, and I got it because when it released last year it had out of the box support for the generation of Ryzen I was purchasing.

Anyways, I'm having trouble finding dimensions other than height for the cooler online - and I was wondering if any if you know if it would/wouldn't fit before I spend over $600 AUD on the cooler.

&amp;#x200B;

So just finished up with the final touches. I removed the drive cage in the bottom so I could add an extra intake fan so in order to mount the HDD I had to order a 3.5"" to 5.25"" drive bay which can also mount two SSD's  on it. 

Got more airflow from 2 SP NZXT fans I took from a Kraken 52 so put the Corsair AF120's on the back and top as exhaust.

Only other things I had to purchase for this build were the GPU, CPU, MB, and RAM. Everything else I already had from other builds that were no longer being used.

Very happy with the way it turned out. CPU and RAM overclocked just fine with good temps. Played around with overclocking the GPU but didn't feel I gained too much from it so left it at stock for now. 

Tested with Metro Exodus and DOOM 2016 so far. Can play Metro Exodus at 1080P 60FPS with occasional dips into low 50's at high. DOOM of course plays amazing. Even on OpenGL at 1440p on Ultra it hit over 60FPS. With Vulcan its well over 100FPS.

Thanks everyone that commented on my original post. Much appreciated.

Or should I go for 3600X as I believe it has better stock cooler in Wraith Spire ?

The price difference between the two is USD 45.

I guess the thinking process here is if I'm to upgrade the cooler for 3600, overall I be spending the same $$ hence should I go 3600X and its stock cooler.

I understand in terms of performance, the gap between these 2 processors is minuscule but I guess to spend the same $$ and getting that minuscule performance, I guess it's a no brainer? Am I missing anything here?

I guess the deal breaker here is if Wraith Spire is also not good for 3600X then it would make sense to purchase 3600 + after market cooler.

My last desktop build was about this time back in 2011. My system held its own for a while and through some modest upgrades was able to game on a few new-ish titles but definitely showed its age and was mired abysmal load times and frequent frame rate stuttering.

I originally made my decision to upgrade in the first quarter of this year but with the pandemic hitting the US it delayed my research and ultimately picking up pieces for this build. I did an apples to apples price comparison on Amazon, Newegg, and my local bestbuy for every part and to my surprise bestbuy was cheapest AND was in stock.

Amd,vegalodon,0,1,"Using an RX570 on Ubuntu 20.04 for gamingHi guys, 

a few days ago I installed the latest ubuntu lts version and finally got to re-download my games on steam and installed them using the proton function. 

I read somewhere that the amd drivers should be working fine out of the box on linux. 

However, I am seeing some serious performance issues compared to windows (I did expect some slight performance downgrades).

The RX570 also ran OCed to 1400Ghz without any issues on windows using the radeon adrenaline drivers. 

My question: is there a way to oc on ubuntu with a similar app? Or any way really? Should I install different drivers for gaming? 

Any help would be much appreciated."

But this got me thinking, OpenCL can potentially run CUDA base RTX Voice, so the possibility is there.

I just want to ask whether there are any current or future initiative to build an in-house AMD solution / Community port RTX Voice to OpenCL? Or, perhaps we should only expect solution like Krisp to work on AMD?"

Amd,A-nom-nom-nom-aly,8,1,"New Build OC AdviceI've just rebuilt my gaming PC, going from a 2600x to a 3800X on a B450 mobo... will be replacing the Mobo later as the first X570 board I bought turned out to have some issues on the USB controller  (Well documented issues regarding Corsair AIO's, according to my research). I also upgraded the memory from 3200 to 3600mhz but dropped from CL16 to CL18

&amp;#x200B;

My 2600X I OC'd just with ryzen master, never pushed hard and with a set max voltage of 1.35 I was stable at around 4.1 to 4.125 all core.

&amp;#x200B;

The current 3800X I've done pretty much the same... max voltage of 1.35 and currently sitting at all core 4.25Ghz... Temps max out at 73ºC under stress testing but that's also while having my system set to the quietest fan settings. Only the 2 fans on the AIO (H115i) can be heard spinning up and never past 50% as the fan curve will only go higher when temps pass 80ºC.  idle temps are around 41ºC in a warm room with ambient around 23-24ºC (house is set to an average of 20ºC, but my home office has always been 3-4ºC warmer due to the equipment and the fact only a 3m section of wall is to the outside (room is only 2.8x3m anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

I know OC's on these can be very random... but what's the average people normally see?

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to keep those max voltages down as the old 2600X had a habit of ramping up to 1.4v and over even when stock... and I noticed a similar thing with the 3800X.  1.35v seems to be one that's quite commonly used."

I am currently attempting to passively cool it (don't worry about it).  


My issue comes with the newer drivers (I believe the change was made with Adreneline ).

Memory State 2 - instead of having mv - N/A. It is now assigned 950mv.

This forces the minimum voltage for the card to be at 950mv and I can't get it any lower. Even if I change Memory State 3 MAX to 900mv, the card will not go below the 950mv set on the Memory State 2.   


The option is greyed out and unable to be selected. I have searched through Soft powerplay tables and can't find anything in there that corresponds to the voltages or clocks showing for Memory states.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been searching old forums and youtube for several hours and can't seem to find any information on this.

It's not being detected anymore in Windows, it's not being detected or funtional at all in Bios (EZ Update, states ""Internet offline"") and it's not detected at all in any hardware info based tool. Basicly the onboard nic of this board is toast, as i had to get out today and buy a wireless PCI-E add-in card to at least get a minimum form of internet on my daily machine.

Are there any other users of the same board that have erratic behaviour of the onboard NIC, and esp suddenly dissapeared in Windows / hardware level? Please note that i've done all the possible testing to exclude a software issue like recent Windows update. The only positive i see is a bunch of lights blinkering when a UTP is plugged in, but thats about it.

\- Cleared CMOS, updated bios to latest (2019) version

\- Disabled, enabled onboard LAN, no effect

\- To the point i've reinstalled W10 completely &gt; no effect

Knowing how erratic it was behaving the last few weeks or months, this is the first time in my life a NIC blew out on me. It's protected using a UPS and having the UTP's passthrough for any surges. So now i'm here with a 200Mbit internet connection only able to use 15mbit of that. Stupid wireless."

I have a RYZEN 7 2700x on a MSI X470 Gaming Plus board that I got a couple years ago from CyberPowerPC(flames are welcome) that runs SUPER hot. 

Idle = 50c 
Cinebench = 90-93c
Gaming = 75-90c 

Cooler = Basic 120mm CoolerMaster AIO that came with the system. 

I’ve tried lowering settings in the BIOS to no avail. I even recently updated the BIOS a couple days ago. 

Precision Boost on default BIOS settings while gaming or running benchmarks seems to drop voltage and clock speeds significantly but temps are still high and I notice a significant throttle in performance when gaming. Looking at other benchmark videos on YouTube, it seems others are able to game perfectly fine on similar hardware at much lower temps than what I’m experiencing and thus, their CPUs are running at proper voltages and clock speeds and no throttling. 

Would a new cooler be the way? I’m looking at the Noctua coolers or the Deep Cool Assassin 3 for air coolers but I’m not sure if I’d be better off just buying the newer Ryzen 5 3600 with the Wraith Prism RGB cooler.

After I got everything installed I started having a look at my temps whilst doing stress tests on both CPU/GPU. My GPU never seems to go above 45C at load which is great. But my CPU seems to be having a much harder time.

3950x looks like it idles around 43-50C according to HWInfo/HWmonitor &amp; Ryzen Master. When under load I am seeing temps of 75C and in prime95 they can hit 80+.  
CinebenchR20 seems to average temp of around 65-70 with peaks of 76 or so over a 6 min continuous run.  
For these early tests, I kept the pump RPM around 4500 &amp; the Fans at 1200 each. The coolant didn't move beyond 30 for the tests. Ambient temp was 23.5C.  
Stock speeds so far and boosting seems to be between 4.3GHz average (all core tends to be 4 - 4.1)

My question is: are these temps high for a custom loop with all that cooling? or is the 3950x just such a powerhouse that those temps will always be around?  
I feel like the CPU should be following near the GPU temps of 33 C at idle, not 43-50 C.  
Any help would be super helpful, as I am starting to think I need to pull it all apart and check the CPU was sitting ok. I have all the latest drivers &amp; BIOS 1.7 installed.

Cheers!

Post your issues directly into this thread as replies. **All other tech support posts will still be removed, per the rules; this is the only exception.**

----------------------------------------------------

##Bad Example (don't do this)

&gt;  
bf1 crashes wtf amd

________________________________________

##Good Example (please do this)

&gt;Skyrim: Free Sync and V Sync causes flickering during low frame rates, and generally lower frame rates observed (about 10-30% drop dependant on system) when Free Sync is on
 
&gt;  
##System Configuration:  
**Motherboard:** GIGABYTE GA-Z97 Gaming GT  
**CPU:** Intel i5 4790  
**Memory:** 16GB GDDR5  
**GPU:** ASUS R9 Fury X  
**VBIOS:** 115-C8800100-101 [^^How ^^do ^^I ^^find ^^this?](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001309.htm)  
**Driver:** Crimson 16.10.3  
**OS:** Windows 10 x64 (1511.10586) [^^How ^^do ^^I ^^find ^^this?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system)

&gt;
##Steps to Reproduce:  
1\. Install necessary driver, GPU and medium-end CPU  
2. Enable Free Sync  
3. Set Options to Ultra and 1920 x 1080 resolution  
4. Launch game and move to an outdoor location  
5. Indoor locations in the game will not reproduce, since they generally give better performance  
6. Observe flickering and general performance drop  
&gt;
##Expected Behavior:
Game runs smoothly with good performance with no visible issues

&gt;
##Actual Behavior:
Frame rate drops low causing low performance, flickering observed during low frame rates

&gt;
##Additional Observations:

&gt; Skyrim has forced double buffered V Sync and can only be disabled with the .ini files  
To Disable V Sync: C:\Users""User""\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\Skyrimprefs.ini and edit iVSyncPresentInterval=1 to 0  
1440p has improved frame rate, anything lower than 1080p will lock FPS with V Sync on  
Able to reproduce on i7 6700K and i5 3670K system, Sapphire RX 480, Reference RX 480, and Reference Fiji Nano

With \~4075 MHz

So, is my FIT voltage so high? \~1.425V?

When the temps reached \~70C the voltage dropped, It went to Min 1.337V Max \~1.37V

But then the temps dropped to \~60C and the voltage rised again to the previous values

It always boosts between 4 and 4.2ghz and voltage is set at around 1.4v all the time.
My motherboard is up to date and also windows 10.
The only solution to drop the temperture is to set 1.2v with 3.6 or either 3.8ghz on the cpu using amd overdrive software because i don't mind a little less performance for better temperatures and acoustics (using a cooler master hyper 212 black edition) and now it doesn't exceed 55 degrees on load and around 35 minimum.

Amd,skyunderearth,0,1,"GPU not performing correctly after switching to RyzenHello everyone. I have a serious issue.

**Basically, my GPU won't utilise over 50% which is causing games to show awful performance after I switched to Ryzen. I'm not sure switching was relevant or causing the issue, but it may be worth mentioning.)

I recently built my first PC except reusing my previous PSU, storage devices and GPU.

Coming from an Intel i5-4670, my specs are:

 Ryzen 5 1600AF

16GB 3000MHz DDR4 RAM

ASRock B450M Steel Legend

ASUS Radeon R9 290X DirectCU II OC GPU

620W Corsair HX620W PSU

I transferred the same drives over, 2 SSDs and 1 HDD.

For example;

With GTA V, when I perform any action, the frames drop to below 10 from around 70. Usually, the card runs a perfectly stable 90FPS Average on mostly max settings 1080p.

With DOOM, FPS just completely refuses to go above 40. Preset ultra. Before, I could easily hit a solid 60+ FPS.

I changed all settings lowest and results were the same so power of the card isn't an issue.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) usually runs at 120FPS average. Now, it runs at barely 90FPS and drops to 40-60FPS while I do nearly anything. The CPU is not bottlenecking as it rarely goes over 50% (in MW it ranges from 65-90%)

CPU temps never go over 75 degrees under load.

I'm wondering what the problem is and how I can fix it?

I've tried:

Motherboard BIOS settings in performance mode

Windows Power mode in high performance

Game Mode off

Latest chipset drivers

Latest GPU drivers

Please note I don't have another PC to test the GPU with, but I don't see how it could be a hardware fault anyway as nothing damage-worthy has happened to the card."

Amd,palescoot,1,1,"I figured out my new 5700XT's stability issue, and I only feel a little incredibly stupid. You might get a laugh.Figured y'all would appreciate this for a little levity around here. I got an MSI ""GAMING X"" 5700 XT card this past weekend as a ""treat yo self"" quarantine upgrade. My first observation was, holy shit, this card is huge. Now, three important notes, I built in a relatively small mATX cube case, my CPU is a 3900X, and my previous GPU was a blower card.

I was able to get the new card to fit (just barely, goddamn that cooler is massive), and I started up some games. It ran well for a while, runs my favorite games like a dream at 1440P variable refresh 30-144... But after 25-30 minutes of gameplay, my system hung and restarted. I tried DDU and installing drivers fresh, I tried 19.12.1, 20.2.2, 20.3.1, a fresh Windows install, no change. No other artifacts or black screens, just a crash and restart.

After several days of trying something new, testing and failing, I finally had the bright idea to... Check all my case fans. Because I have a small cube case and one intake/one exhaust fan, airflow is super important. And guess what I found? I had disconnected the RGB cable from my 3900X's cooler and forgot to plug it back in... And said cable was preventing my exhaust fan from moving.

**I HAD INADVERTENTLY DISABLED MY CASE'S ONE EXHAUST FAN, WHILE ALSO REMOVING THE GPU BLOWER THAT ALSO EXHAUSTED HEAT.**

My system was just overheating...

Now that the exhaust fan is running again, I've had zero problems in any game, benchmark or stress test. For good measure, I undervolted and underclocked the card a little bit (1150 mv / 2006 MHz) since it seems the MSI Gaming X version does run a little fast and power hungry by default, and to mind overall thermals. Now I can say with certainty that I love this card :)"
Amd,spychi88,43,1,"I think I have a golden chip 3600x OC @4.48Ghz 

Hi all,  
I think I got lucky and won on silicon lottery, my AMD CPU 3600x reaches 4.48Ghz stable on air cooling.  
Full specs below in HWINFO, on top of that I am using Cooler Master CMH500 with all fans configured as follows - two front 200mm fans, one top 200mm and one at the back 120mm.  
My CPU cooler is an old (8 year old) Noctua NH U12P SE2 .  
I have run Cinabench R20 on a cylce for 15 minutes.  
Results and temps below.

I think I will push my luck and try to run it at 4.5 Ghz... before that I had an Intel i5-6600k with the same cpu cooler and case ... to be quite frank I think I was also lucky with the CPU because I could run it stable at 5Ghz on all cores.

Anyway any thoughts ? Am I lucky?

Amd,theantipop,58,1,"Upgraded from GTX 1080 to RX 5700 XT - Loving it!Hey all,

Recently just upgraded my AIO water cooled GTX 1080 to a reference RX 5700 XT. I have placed my AIO cooler on the 5700 XT, which went off without a hitch, and has been performing amazingly well.

The latest drivers (which I've read includes a multitude of fixes) are working flawlessly, and coming from Nvidia, I'm particularly impressed by the one click 'GPU Overclock' or 'Undervolt', as well as the Ctrl-Shift-O overlay that displays all the necessary information without being intrusive, and can easily be taken off. Very handy.

Overall, after coming from Nvidia (GTX980Ti then GTX 1080), I am really enjoying being back on Radeon (after my old R9 290), and have been pleasantly delighted by the performance of the hardware and the user friendliness of the software.

I've recorded a solid 20-25fps frame bump in Modern Warfare, where my card boosted to 2075mhz, whilst drawing only 165w of power, and staying around the 70-75c mark. Very satisfied with that!   
(I tried 2.1ghz, but ended up drawing nearly 200w of power, and junction temp rose to 95c)"

I'll will be doing some personally comparisons to performance compared to my old 1060 3GB at 1080p.

Games like Battlefield or Star Wars Battlefront this card destroys in, absolutely love it; however, this card disappoints in more than a handful of games compared to my old 1060. These games include: Minecraft, CSGO, Escape from Tarkov, Halo games(reach and CE), Just Cause 3, GTAV, Squad, Far Cry New Dawn and Star wars Jedi: Fallen Order. My performance in these games were either worse than my 1060 or about the same, which is quite annoying after paying $400. 


I originally thought it was because my clocks on the card were between 800-1800Mhz,but after the last driver update(An amazing update by AMD, fixed a lot of my problems) I was able to get my clocks up to and over 2Ghz, but still the performance was the same.

I've tried most if not all fixes that I've seen on reddit, from disabling ULPS to getting two cables for PCI connection instead of daisy chain.

Amd,arkl2020,0,1,"Umm wow - 2700x - not all cores are working**Crazy long story, but I am shocked and super excited right now, if you wanna answer my question: it is at the bottom in bold.**

I am honestly kind of at shock. A while back I made a post because one morning I woke up and my newly built computer (at this time maybe 3 months old) just turned off and every time I tried to turn it back on it would get to the Windows boot logo and basically ""go dead"" (I made a post about it eventually in PCmasterrace but got nothing useful out of it, it was more of a hail mary anyway). I ended up running MemTest86 and kept getting errors on Test 6 Moving 64 byte blocks so I thought the issue was with my RAM but I have had enough experience with building computers that it just did not feel right to me, something was telling me not to send in the memory to be RMA'd just yet. So, for over a month now I have been using my laptop, which kicks ass for being a cheap laptop (Acer Aspire 5) but I could only use it for multi-media purposes and some web browsing.

&amp;#x200B;

I was about to start the RMA process for the memory but could not get it out of my head that something else was causing the problem, so I removed all the components and decided I would completely rebuild everything. It isn't even inside the case as I type it, just a motherboard sitting on top of its' own box with the bare essentials. I decided to run Memtest 1 more final time but with a lot of tweaks done in bios from ""Auto"" to all manual set settings. When I ran memtest, I got the same exact errors but this time I noticed something that I didn't originally:  it had the CPU set to round robin mode and the errors were happening on processor ""12"" and ""13"" respectively (it never tested any of the others since these caused so many errors it would just shut the test down). I have no clue why, but that gut feeling came over me again.... what if I just test 1 single processor/core? No errors...... test passed.

&amp;#x200B;

So, excited and kind of angry (my PC has been sitting on the floor for 45 days or so, untouched due to this) I went into the BIOS and manually set it to boot up only uses the first 4 processors. Booted just fine, no problems.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't believe it, my PC is running just fine (well, not really since not all cores are working...) at 4 cores and 8 threads. I am about to restart and get back into BIOS to see if I can run it with 6 cores and just avoid using cores 7 and 8 for now.

&amp;#x200B;

How did it this happen? I haven't OCed this chip since I haven't had a need to yet. I have left everything ""as-is"" after throwing it into this setup (I did originally have a different board but had to RMA it and while waiting for the replacement to arrive I switched; from the MSI Tomahawk Max to the ASUS B450-F) so the last thing I was ever expecting was a CPU problem. Even crazier is that when I just re-built it 30 or so minutes ago I accidentally pulled the CPU out of it's socket with the heatsink! I couldn't believe when I looked at it and saw no bent or missing pins but thought to myself ""they must be bent so slightly I just can't see it with my eyes"" but nope no pin problem! I stupidly did not think to turn on the PC first since it wasn't in a good state and didn't think about the fact the thermal paste had been sitting there cold for over a month now, and I have no clue what I was thinking on my last build as I had thrown WAAAAY too much thermal paste on it. Like literally at least twice as much, it was hard to clean as it was going over the edge and touching my fingers when holding the CPU by it's sides. I almost got thermal paste all over the pins! I basically soaked the CPU in some 99.9% alcohol, wiped it well, and let it dry off. Don't know where I was going with all this, just overfilled with emotions right now and had to tell someone lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**The question behind this long ass story:**

I still don''t understand what caused this, as for the first 3 months or so everything worked completely fine, even after the motherboard switch. Do you guys just think I got a bad chip and should RMA it to AMD? I have never had a bad CPU in my life before and the first time I ever RMA'd something was actually my first motherboard from this build. It seems like my luck is horrible on this build, but no user error and I'm finding RMA'ing things is a lot easier than I expected, just sucks to have to be without the computer for a bit due to 1 part...

&amp;#x200B;

**Something I just randomly thought of:** what if it isn't a CPU problem but actually something with the motherboard?! Is that possible? I should have my replacement board from MSI here pretty soon, maybe I should hold off till it arrives and test with that before RMA'ing the CPU... If this doesn't make sense and the motherboard can't be the cause of the problem, please let me know.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a programmer by day, gamer by night and I'm looking for the very best settings to balance single and multi core workload performance on my 3950x. Curious what ya'll are getting, your setups, and what settings work best for you. Here's my best so far.

Shout out to core 0 for being the real MVP &lt;3

**Setup:** 

* CPU: AMD 3950x, top bin from  [siliconlottery.com](https://siliconlottery.com/)
* RAM: DDR4 3600 G.Skill Neo CL16
* Board: ROG Crosshair VIII Hero
* Cooler: EK custom loop, 360mm rad (basically this:  [https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-kit-p360](https://www.ekwb.com/shop/ek-kit-p360) ) 
* OCCT running in the background over several hours of gaming/working or just surfing the reddits. 

**Current BIOS settings all default except:** 

* PBO scalar: 3x
* \- 0.05 core voltage offset
* LLC level 1

**Up next:** 

* New water block from  [https://optimuspc.com/](https://optimuspc.com/) on its way (should net -5c) 
* Going to try the EDC 0 trick posted here. 

**A Few Things I've tried:** 

* PBO 300/230/230, 2x scalar (various voltage offsets) - ran super hot for me (75c-80c) and netted +200 in CB r20.  Clock boosts topped at 4.65ghz on core 0. 
* PBO 130/85/110, 10x scalar. Saw core boosts over 4.7ghz on core 0 and 1, CB r20 multi-core tanked to -500 off my best

Amd,juanmamedina,54,1,"Last AMD Survey for new features | There is nothing needed thereDear AMD Radeon Team,

Today i completed my survey from the drivers app and realized that the only thing that i could found useful in all those options was the improved fan control. I really found the rest of the features nice to have **but not needed at all.**

The only thing that im asking AMD to have within the drivers control panel, since i bought my first R9 280X 6 years ago, is **an improved VSYNC control.** Enable Vsync driver option doesn't work at all and force triple buffering only works for OpenGL apps (an option that i would like to use in Devil May Cry 5 for example, since the in-game vsync uses double buffers and causes me framerate drops).

After having an RX580, an RX Vega 64 and now porting a flaming Radeon VII, i still doesn't have a proper driver vsync options. I used to install radeonpro.exe, a perfect app that allowed AMD users to have the same tweaking capabilities than the Nvidia users, radeonpro.exe stopped the support and is not working anymore with lastest drivers.

So, which options are actually needed? Here is my list of features that i really miss:

&amp;#x200B;

**1. Force VSYNC.** (for DX9-12 and Vulkan games).

**2. Force Triple Buffering.** (for DX9-12 and Vulkan games).

**3. Half-Refresh Rate VSYNC.** (Its anoyinng to setup my screen to 30hz inside windows options everytime i open and close a game that i want to play at 4KUltra30fps on my HDR TV with my gamepad).

**4. Adaptive-Sync and Half-Refresh Rate Adaptive-Sync.** (Enhanced Sync is completely useless, under 60fps is vsync off, perfect, but over 60fps is an stuttering mess, so i have to enable enhanced sync and cap fps using RTSS to achieve something similar to adaptive sync, but its still an stuttering mess, RTSS cap helps but doesn't fix the stuttering at all.)

**5. A proper fps cap.** Something that can maintain the frametimes and the framerates stable when the gpu reaches the frame cap.

**6. Bring VRS to Vega10, Vega20 and Navi10.** Please, don't make this feature exclusive for RDNA 2.0. We all know that this doesn't need exclusive hardware capabilities, just like raytracing does.

**7. The improved GPU fan control** is really needed for some users (not my case).

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, there was an option in the survey for improved radeon boost support, people didnt vote it, why? simple, **Radeon Boost is totally senseless**. We don't need games to lower the render resolution when we move the mouse, **we need games to lower the render resolution when the fps are under an fps target.** That is Adaptive Resolution with an fps target, and you know it perfectly, since it's use is really extended in the current AMD consoles. Thats how Radeon Boost should work, and what PC gamers need.

Finally, not everything is bad. I have to congratulate AMD for showing to all PC gamers that DLSS is actually an stupid feature thnx to **Radeon Image Sharpening**, a feature that works with every single game and doesn't need developers to program and train a complex and advanced IA with exclusive hardware (tensor cores) to achieve WORST results than a nice adaptive sharpening filter like AMD RIS. Thanks for that, i think that we all really apreciate it, but please, take a look to VSYNC options.

Best regards,"
Amd,DasRedBeard87,0,1,"Just switched over to AMD. New install, bios just updated. What should I do now?So I've been on team Blue for a couple years but just the other night decided to swap my system out for AMD. So the install went swell. Ram speeds fixed, bios updated, fresh windows install. Found out the nvidia control panel is now a microsoft store app? Not happy about that so depending on what happens with AMD's ""NVIDIA Killer"" i might switch to AMD GPU's as well. 

So since I'm pretty much new to AMD. Is there anything I should do in my bios or any specific programs or things I should do in Windows to make this system run the best that it can?

I found a good deal for a Corsair H80i V2 Pro so I purchased it.

Amd,dschanoeh,27,1,"Zen+/Zen2 setup for a low-power headless serverHi,

I'm thinking about upgrading my headless home server with a newer Ryzen setup. I’m currently running an i3 4170 and the whole system draws around 35-40W at idle including 3 HDDs and an SSD.

Initially I just wanted to upgrade RAM but feels like a waste to buy DDR3 at this point.

My goals are:

* Same or better power consumption
* Low price
* More cores and maybe slightly better single core performance
* ECC RAM

I’m currently looking at buying:

* Ryzen 5 1600 AF
* AsRock B450M Pro4
* A single (for lower power usage and upgradeability) module of 16GB ECC RAM 

I might also get a Ryzen 5 3600 for my desktop that could “trickle-down” to my server in a few years.

Does that seem like a reasonable setup for my goals and are there better alternatives that I’m missing? Or do you think the upgrade isn’t worth it and I should wait for Zen2 price drops?

Anyway, I'm getting crazy stuff like 58oc on Desktop, which seems high, but then if I play Battlefield 5 I'm getting 82-84oC with 105-110oC Junction Temps.

After looking around the card will thermal throttle @ 110, so this is bad news, the card is generally below 2,000Mhz regardless of the fan speed. It does however sound like a 747 taking off.

Now the speeds are good, kinda, the temps are nearing 20oC higher than sites who've tested these cards in stress tests and the FPS is a bit fishy.  I've had a few black screen crashes and I can't find where in this Trixx software I'm supposed to be able to switch the Overclock to game or oc, nice one Sapphire your software is actually awful!

So running the AMD Software, (which is actually amazing Nvidia should be sad with how abysmal their software is in comparison) I see the fans are going over 2k RPM which seems high as hell, and it is indeed.

So to me, I think I've got a dodgy card, does anyone have any 5700 XT experience with temps? Everything is set to default/auto on the AMD Software Tuning Tab, I've tried different fan speeds but it seems to not even work?  I try the GPU undervolt that doesn't seem to do anything either - and this Wattman wherever it is seems to be missing so I can't try undervolts like people were advertising.

But either way with that I seriously doubt the fastest and coolest 5700 XT Card on the market should be thermal throttling?

Amazon wanted me to contact Sapphire and deal with them (the GPU arrived today) and yes I had to ""ensure there was no dust on the GPU"", great one amazon, 1 day old GPU caked up in dust.

Amd,huuyi456,39,1,"A letter to AMD from a frustrated fan/customer/investor. (Y’all might actually be high over there)I have been a usually quiet reddit user but my experience with the 5700XT and more particularly AMD’s software has frustrated me to the point I can no longer  keep quiet. Anyways here goes .... (If you’re gonna downvote me go ahead all I ask if that you at least read half of the post) 

To AMD,

Tbh from my perspective your software is why your GPU division will never hold a candle to your competitor Nvidia. People buy into your brand are frustrated and move on to Nvidia. Even if you improve you think they will come back after that kind of experience. You aim to offer the best price to performance but all that goes out the window when you can’t even get the product to work out the door. Look at your disastrous launch of the 5600xt.Look at how you screwed over your manufacturing partners. Look at your stock price these past weeks. You guys had such an amazing 2019 and your starting 2020 like this. “Big Navi is coming”  you’re getting ready to release a high end card to combat Nvidia’s when you can barely make your mid and lower end cards functional, like who does the planning for AMD cause lord in heaven your priorities are whack as hell. Why not have your CPU division coach your GPU division on how to make products that work more than half the time. You released the Radeon 2020 Adrenalin with new features but did not put a thought into stabilizing the drivers. This has been an issue plaguing your products for years. Why can’t you guys just take user feedback halt all other operations. Stop spending your limited R&amp;D budget on dumb things like shiny user faces and make your existing products functional. I shouldn’t have to reboot my PC 5 times to play a basic game like Bioshock: Infinite because your drivers keep crashing. Every time you guys try to achieve something and combat Nvidia all they need to do is make one move and you guys become confused  it was the case for the 5700 series when you slashed prices out the door  launch and now 5600 again with this last minute spec bump that everyone who paid for the card probably will not get how do you guys not see things like this coming. I love what your company stood for which was bringing down prices so PC gaming could be accessible to people who can’t pay the outrageous prices Nvidia wants to charge for their products. I’m stuck with the card I bought from AMD  as I cannot return it anymore so I have to start saving for an Nvidia GPU. Get your head out out of your asses over there.A few weeks ago I ran into an AMD employee in a train as he proudly displayed his ID. I tried to talk to say hi and converse with him  and see what goes on at the company but the dude was just dismissive and tbh acted kind of retarded (I’m not saying this to be a dick he honestly furrowed his brow when I told him I loved their products and what they stand for) . I just chalked it up to him just being a dick but now I see the guy is just part of a wider problem back at your company. I just hope he doesn’t reflect the mentality of the company as a whole. You guys have worked hard to to grow your brand and your stocks compared to the beginning of last year reflect that. Now you’re about to wreck all that over some stupid decisions. You have promised to focus on stability now as per your last post let hope that’s a sign of good things to come. Your company has potential even more than your competitors. Your hardware is amazing look at your CPU division ask them why they deliver such amazing products and ask your GPU division to emulate that. In the end all we can do is wait and see. I doubt anyone from AMD will read this but thank you to anyone who took the time to read to the end even this who open this and write me off as another angry unlucky 5700xt user. Just know There are people that love your company and just want to see it prosper so it hurts quite a bit to see these things happen."

Amd,Rickles360,36,1,"Will AMD eventually offer a more affordable way onto the TRX40 platform?So TRX40 is killing it in single core and multicore workloads.  They are dream chips and they are priced as such starting at $1400.  Currently the strategy to straddle the HEDT offerings between 2 different motherboards is not ideal especially when the consumer platform (3950x) is out performing the old HEDT (2950x) platform.  Possibly, AMD and customers regret a chip like the 1900x where the price landed in a weird spot between 1800x and 1920x/1950x.  But looking back, if you started there you had a great opportunity to move up to 2nd gen threadripper which has seem some good sales.  The same can be said for the Intel side with the x299 platform which Linus completely shat on in his famous 'walk in the rain' video, but with hindsight hasn't been the worst thing ever sold.

I think there's something to be said about low end chips at the start of a new HEDT platform.  They might not seem like the best value, but what they do often offer is a killer upgrade path and all the benefits that come with HEDT, (namely killer IO with way more PCI lanes).  AMD seems to have all the bases covered right now and they are probably being careful not to cannibalize their own sales.  But it seems like a cheaper chip to get started on the TRX40 socket would open some doors and I'd like to see it happen if not this generation than maybe it will happen during the next go around for threadripper.  All the benefits of 7nm but with far more robust mobos, relative affordability, and an upgrade path.  Without having a chip in this slot you must choose your trade off: Price (3970x), Single thread performance (2950x), or IO (3950x).   Arguably you could say a 16 core on TRX40 has the trade off of lower core count than some, for higher price than others, but I still think it would be a great ""value"" option for those trying to avoid a dying platform (TR40) and get more IO (than AM4).  This also would set you up for the future when prices chips like the 3990x come down from the stratosphere. 

P.S. Somewhere out there... at least one person who somehow missed that Linus video is probably selling a 7640x for $200 and upgrading to a 10980x when switching to a 3950x would have cost significantly more to budget for a less capable mobo.  I know this is a silly point and most people don't need lots of PCI lanes but some people want them and don't want to go backwards in single core performance to threadripper 2 with no upgrade path.  It's that or drop the price of a beater car to get into Threadripper 3."

Searching through reddit is giving me second thoughts on the 5700XT since I have read that the drivers are bad. Is the $125 difference worth it? Choosing 5700XT would let me have a better cooler and/or a better storage.

I have the Radeon r7 370 and I never had this issue prior to the last 2 updates.   


Any ideas?

Amd,criznittles,0,1,"Windows 10/3950x sometimes running extremely slowWhat might be causing Windows 10 to randomly and suddenly run so slow that simple right click menus have trouble opening? Even the mouse cursor locks up for seconds at a time, requiring much longer than usual to close things and restart. It's not common, but the fact that it has happened a few times is concerning. What's strange is that there's almost no load while it happens, i don't know how to diagnose it.  
Is this an issue anyone else is having lately? I didn't expect the 3950x to ever run slow like this.  
It sometimes happens while working, with a few apps and windows open - things will feel like they froze, then everything just goes extremely slow, but a restart seems to eliminate the problem. What's going on though?

Hello

So I'm thinking on buying a Rx 5700 XT, but i need some help to make sure everything goes smooth.

I'm  thinking on getting the Nitro+, the think is, my case is the meshify C,  wich allow GPU with 315 mm lenght with front fan mounted (I have 2   NF-A14  noctua on the front).

The Nitro+ has 306 on lenght, it will be a tight fit, will this bring any problems?

Another  thing i've read about, is that this card will need two power cables. Is  this recommended? Or it depends on the quality of the PSU (i have a  corsair 750 RMi gold)?

Finnaly,  it's quite hard to get good monitors around here, so I will be staying  1080p for a while, will this also bring any problems?

Amd,allenout,37,0,"How AMD Dominates the CPU marketAMD has seemed to go from nowhere to absolutely dominating the CPU market to the point of embarrassing Intel. The way they achieved it is genius.

AMD has high-end CPUs released on the Zen 2 7nm node which means they get high performance and high efficiency. Because of this, they can charge high prices, and still get amazing sales(the 3950X is number 1 of the best selling processors on Amazon in the US).

However AMD always had trouble because if they supported the high-end then that leaves the lower-end open for Intel, AMD stops this by using cheap 14/12nm wafers for Zen and Zen + chips, such as the 1600X and 2700X to dominate the low end at $70-$100. This is how AMD takes such market share.

This should be a lesson for RTG. Firstly, they need to back-port Navi to GloFo 14/12nm or even TSMC 16nm if they can, then release higher-end 7nm Navi chips to get market share. AMD should then begin to dominate CPU and GPU."

Overclock workflow was: 

1. Open Ryzen Master and create a new Max OC profile. 
2. Include and Set control mode to Manual for CPU.
3. Include and set Cores Section to mirror speeds of core 0. Speed set to 4.4 Ghz initially. 
4. Include and set Voltage Control to 1.4 V initially. 
5. Press apply and test. 
6. If test passes, perform a CPU-Z benchmark to confirm there are actual gains. 
7. Repeat with 25 Mhz CPU OC increment. As soon as a test fails, increase voltage by 0.025 V. 

Note: I understand this is a very basic way to test. But today I was just curious to see what OC I can hit with some form of stability. I will be performing more extensive stability tests later. The final OC was stress tested on CPU-Z for 30+ minutes with no issues though. This is the first time I OC the desktop. 

\---------------------------------------------------------- Important Question ----------------------------------------------------------

What are the expected temperatures for this CPU running the CPU-Z stress test at 4.4 Ghz OC  @ 1.4v for 15 minutes? My cooling setup is a MasterCooler MasterLiquid 240L and all benchmarks/stress tests are done with fans running at 100%. Any contributions to this question will be greatly appreciated since I'm not sure if the 240L is performing as it should. 

Here are my results so far with running CPU-Z stress test at different voltages and frequencies for 30+ minutes, room temp at \~ 60 °F: 

* 4.4 Ghz at 1.4 V: 73 °C
* 4.575 Ghz at 1.4 V: 76 °C
* 4.2 Ghz at 1.4 V: 71 °C
* 4.2 Ghz at 1.2V: 57 °C - For those who don't want to run their CPU at 1.4 V (even though its still operating within spec). 
* Precision Overboost enabled from Ryzen Master, 4.150 Ghz at 1.37 V: 70 °C (I kinda expected it to be better than a manual overclock, but it's not, more than likely due to some underlying reasons regarding stability). 

Build:

* CPU: Ryzen 3700X
* GPU: XFX AMD RX 5700 (flashing to XT BIOS soon)
* RAM: G.Skill Trident RGB 16 GB - 3200 Mhz (Still need to tighten the timings on this RAM)
* PSU: Seasonic Focus Gold 850FX
* Case: CoolerMaster H500
* Cooling: MasterLiquid 240L 
* Motherboard Asus ROG Strix B450-F 
* Less than one month old.   


Fun fact: With a manual OC at 4.4 Ghz and 1.4 V, I ran a Prime 95 torture test. Instantly hit 94 °C and 150 W of CPU power, freaked out, but let it run for a few more seconds out of curiosity to see if the cooler can sustain the temp. It slowly rose and hit 95 °C within seconds. Never used Prime 95 before and would have fried my CPU if I was unsuspecting and wasn't watching the temp and power readings."

But what if the are priced the same or very close, like in 5500XT/1650 Super case, or in rumored 5600XT price case?

When I was choosing whether to buy RX 580 or GTX 1060 in April 2017, I went with Radeon because my then-new cheap 1080p monitor supported Freesync, and the RX 580 was slightly cheaper, as a bonus.

So I used the data I got from Thaiphoon burner and imported to my DRAM calculator to generate some numbers, It just won't work. After a close look, I found that the numbers that is imported by the read xmp button and the numbers from thaiphoon burner is different, very different. By automatically reading the XMP from DRAM calculator, and applied ""Calculate FAST"", i'm seeing some very aggressive numbers, tried these, didn't work. The numbers from ""Calculate Safe"" is pretty much the XMP that i'm using right now, so probably no point trying out? I did some memtest to verify if it is a good RAM and it passed, 0 errors.

I'm not sure at this point if there is any point to continue tweaking the RAM i'm having right now. I have already ordered some corsair rgb pro rams with 3600mhz speed to replace the current ones. Hope they will work better than my current ones."

Amd,MONGSTRADAMUS,0,1,"3800x running hotBefore I take apart my whole pc I would like to hear some ideas why my 3800x is running so hot its idling around 45-50 C which I think is quite high for a 280 MM aio. I have tried different patterns with applying thermal paste to my ryzen cpu. I have tried pea, x , and smoothing paste to cover entire cpu. None really have any discernible differences in temps. I am starting to wonder is it my subpar ab350 pro4 motherboard. I don't recall ever having that many issues cooling my 1600 but that a ryzen 5 and 65W chip so that may be why. My 1600 would always idle around 27c. When I upgraded to this 3800x I rarely see anything below 45 c .

Amd,Dey_EatDaPooPoo,4,1,"Overclocking and Tuning the New Samsung M-Die IC on 2nd Gen RyzenGot these under a week ago in a [GeIL Evo Potenza AMD 32GB \(2x16GB\) DDR4-3000 CL16 kit with part # GAPB432GB3000C16ADC](https://imgur.com/3FIkMIV). They were released very recently on 10/07/19 according to Newegg and were being advertised as being for Ryzen, there were no reviews, I wanted to upgrade to 32GB and I got them for a steal ($93 before and $74 after discounts) so I decided to go for it.  The memory itself was manufactured very recently on week 45 of 2019 or 11/04-08/19.  Spent a good amount of my day yesterday tuning them to the absolute best they'll do on my platform so I'll be sharing results and any peculiarities about this 16Gb density IC here.

**Optimized vs optimized, overall, they perform between Hynix MFR and Micron Rev. E. They clock very similarly to MFR but can be tightened quite a bit better overall, and while they can also tighten better vs Rev. E overall, they're at a significant frequency disadvantage which means Rev. E is still a decent amount faster. However, you need to keep in mind this is a significant amount cheaper and basically the cheapest DRAM period, that you can get at the available 32GB and 64GB capacities. A 32GB kit of this stuff can be had at or under $100 frequently vs Rev. E which is at or just under $150 usually.**

They are 2x16GB, meaning they're single-rank despite using 16GB modules. They do not clock high, but they do tighten up very good vs XMP overall (which is what's most important on Ryzen anyway). They also do not like higher voltage, as when not 100% stable at the exact same settings they produced a significant amount more memory errors, more quickly, at 1.4V vs 1.35V. [The frequency sweet spot for them was 3200MHz as that allowed the timings to be tightened a good bit. Setting to 3066 or 3000MHz barely gave any additional headroom for tightening, especially since some of the secondaries can be set as low as they'll go anyway.
](https://imgur.com/l5tZg84)

[Their weakness when it comes to timings are tCL which lowest they would go is 16, tRC at 58, and tRFC at 520 \(very similar to Rev. E when it comes to these\), but they're very good \(especially for a budget IC\) when it comes to tRCDWR at 15, tRAS at 28, tRRDS and tRRDL at 4, tFAW at 8, tWTRS at 4, tWR at 10 and tCWL at 10, tRTP at 8, and lastly tRDRDSD and tRDRDDD at 4](https://imgur.com/E95fpOS)--I tested all of these as well as the remaining timings for stability, and this is as tight as they'll go. Due to the overall strong secondary timings coupled with being single-rank, memory latency is good for a budget IC at 68.2ns.

[Compared to my 16GB kit of G.Skill Trident Z part # F4-3200C16D-16GTZB Hynix MFR \(also tuned as good as they'll go\) which perform best at 3066MHz](https://imgur.com/SI0NJ1R) (can tighten timings a lot better than 3200) these do 49,400MB/s vs 47,500MB/s reads, 48,500MB/s vs 46,000MB/s writes, and 45,500MB/s vs 43,700MB/s copy. Latency is the same. Not a massive improvement, but notably better especially considering they're slightly cheaper than a 32GB kit of 3000 or 3200MHz CL16 MFR.

[Compared to my 16GB kit of Patriot Viper Steel Series 3866 CL18 kit with part # PVS416G386C8K take into account Hynix DJR seems to perform particularly poorly on 1st and 2nd gen Ryzen](https://imgur.com/RPHMk7v) (cannot go higher than 3266 stable for me unless you set ridiculously loose timings), but good on 3rd gen Ryzen and Intel. Buildzoid was able to get some decent results out of these with a 3700X in a recent video. [On this platform, the best frequency overall was 3200 since that allowed tightening timings a significant amount.](https://imgur.com/2Lj1XDy) However, they didn't really do any appreciably better than the Samsung M-Die with these doing 49,600 vs 49,400MB/s reads, 48,600 vs 48,500MB/s writes, and the same 45,500MB/s copy. Lastly, latency only improved by 0.8ns, so on this platform they're not worth it considering you can get twice the memory for $13-$20 more on average.

**TL;DR: If you want 32GB for very cheap (usually at or under $100) that'll perform decently after tuning this should be your new go-to if you're a budget enthusiast regardless of what platform you're on, but they're particularly good for the money if you have a 1st or 2nd gen Ryzen.** To me, they perform good enough and have a high capacity (especially at the rock-bottom pricing I got them for) so I'll stick with them long-term."

Repost fail-flair!

I just picked up a 5700 which is my first amd video card since the 4770.
My living room TCL TV 4k is extremely blurry even at native 4k with all video cards just when a computer is connected. Any other device, Xbox, PS4, switch, it's fine but not my computer.

The idea is to adjust sharpness on the display which is greyed out, but only on the computer and there is no option to use it, but sport mode does help a tiny bit just nowhere near enough. 4k native looks like 640p without aliasing to give you an idea.

This isn't an issue I have with the TV though the thing is with my old Nvidia card I found an option under display and color that states ""type of content reported to display"" if you select full screen video I believe BAM! you're in heaven.

My question is is there anything like that under Radeon settings that I might be missing? I already tried fiddling with HDCP and didn't get anywhere..."

I am recently purchased a laptop with integrated Vega 8 graphics. I would like to play some light and old games  on this laptop when I am away from my main gaming pc. However there are something I am not quite understand.

1. The core speed of Vega 8 is about 1100  Mhz. I have never reach it, just about 500 - 600 MHz. Is it normal because  I only use it for old games and  haven't tried it on new games to push it? 

2. the memory speed is cap at 1200 MHz. As I understand, Vega 8 take a portion of PC ram to use as its Vram. Then isn't the memory speed be equivalent to Ram bus, in my case 2400 Mhz? Or am I missing something here?

3. I have tried playing Prince of Persia 2008. Being a 10 years old game, Vega 8 even surpass its highest recommended requirements. The fps is constantly at 60fps,however the game overall is laggy. Not because of input lag. The game seem not smooth even though the fps is stable. Is it a compatibility things or something else?

I'll start from the beginning. I've had i7 4700k for the last seven years, and it served me well. Finally I decided to upgrade my components, as obviously I started noticing less performance in new games...
I've always had Intel, always... But I really like what AMD is doing with Ryzen, and so I decided to support them by buying 3700x.
I paired it with an Aorus x570 Elite, 32GB of Corsair RAM (listed on QVL) and RTX 2080.

Now, I'm getting weird problems which I've never had with an Intel build before...
I don't know if it's because the x570 boards are still relatively new or what.
I'm on the latest build of Windows 10, I have the latest bios flashed on the motherboard, I have RAM sticks in the recommended slots, which are A2/B2 slots.

Whats happening is I'm getting really long boot times, it takes ages for the Aorus logo to show up, then when Windows spinning circle shows up, my monitor seems to be loosing signal a couple of times and then it eventually gets into Windows.
Another thing is, sometimes tasks in Windows don't respond, I have a feeling I got this one after installing XBOX Beta App, and when trying to kill them Windows just won't do it.
Sometimes when restarting Windows, it just gets stuck at restart screen and won't do anything until I manually restart it with the button...
I've got 3 drives and 1 optical drive installed (2 SSD, 1 NVME, 1 HDD), when I tried installing another 1TB SSD I had laying around, system went ballistic and one of my other drives appeared corrupted, I thought I lost 1TB of data, but as soon as I disconnected that extra drive it came back to normal...

I don't know lads, with my previous Intel build, whatever I threw at it, it just took it like a champ.
I really want to like this AMD build, but it's so hard when simple things don't work out of the box.
Am I the only one with those kind of problems? I know the long boot time is common enough, but what's the story with the rest of my issues?

Amd,Habenuta,6,1,"Good Settings for the 5700 XT - Power Limit % via Wattman? - in order to reach low GPU temperatures, low noise, less heat..Hi all,

I just got my brand new XFX 5700 XT THICC III and am very happy with that card. My PC is quite small so i had to make some room for this thick GPU. Because of the small case size i am somewhat worried that there might be some heat issues during long sessions - altho i did not really observe that so far.

I would like to do some custom settings in AMD WattMan software, i already tweaked some stuff there, but i am all new to this and have some questions:

- Can reducing the Power limit (%) have any negative effects on the GPU or the system?
-&gt; I thought that reducing the Power Limit % would be the simple solution to this, by reducing the power limit there will be less heat in the system, so also less fan RPMs needed and less noise, also cooler temperatures in generel. So  far it works great for me, i can still play my games in 1440p or 4K with FreeSync active and pretty stable 60FPS for my 4K 60Hz screen. The Power Draw is depending on limiter settings between 120-160W, the fans are dead silent and the GPU doesnt really go much over 60°C. 

- Is this a viable solution or does it make more sense to specifically undervolt/underclock or do some other tweaks?

- Also if i run this as a standard setting while gaming - can there be any negative effects?
i mean ofcourse the performance is a bit less compared to no power limit, but as far as i can tell the difference is not that big - and i can always tweak the limit so that im happy with the results. Is this a legit, simple way to adress Heat and noise issues without negative effects on the hardware?

Thanks a lot in advance guys, cheers, and have a good one.


Im quite happy to finally go back to red, sadly i had some negative experience with AMD GPU before. But now im really amazed by the AMD Software and absolutely happy with the 5700 series and the XFX THICC III in particular. Damn good priced card, has the looks, no RGB lights and stuff i dont want, the real deal."

I noticed something interesting/weird with my monitor, which is a Dell u2414h. The GPU is a VEGA 56. I'm using the sRGB preset on the monitor.

Amd,ocean6csgo,18,0,"Your Thoughts on my 3900x Build List / Spot for Problems**TL;DR:**

* I posted this on /r/buildapc and nobody replied - RIP
* I *think* I've thought most of everything out.
* My build list is CURRENT parts I will be transporting over (already purchased) and some NEW parts I am looking to buy.
* Looking for feedback on certain things seen at the bottom

**Goals/Thoughts:**

* I build for long-term value. Each computer I've built has lasted in 6-8 year increments. Still rocking a 2500K@4.5 GHz currently.
* I need a computer within the next month or two, because my CS:GO frames are dipping far too low.
* CS:GO is really the only game I play; but, I want the capacity to play things like BL3, OW2, Diablo 4, etc.  I also want the ability to get into Video Editing and Streaming.  If I need to upgrade my card, I will later.
* Speaking of Video Cards, you'll notice I'm going with a X570 mobo... I don't ""need"" PCI-E 4.0... My current EVGA 8GB 1070 FTW is going to be the weak point in the build and will need another card within the next 4 years.  There will likely be a lot of PCI-E 4.0 cards out then.  In the meantime, I'm going to get a Sabrent 4.0 SSD to enjoy the 4.0?  Is it needed? No. Overkill? Yes.
* I don't mind paying more for reliability, future-proofing within reason, and future upgrades
* Looking for something a little on the quieter side, so I went with the largest fans I could in each of the spots.  ***I'm not sure if the fans I've selected will be too much/too loud***
   * The Meshify comes with two Dynamic X2 GP-12 (120mm).  I'm going to move the two to the top for exhaust.  The top exhaust can fit 2x 140mm maximum.
   * One Noctua NF-S12A (120mm) for rear exhaust (largest fan possible for rear exhaust) -- ***I'm open to dropping this one and just leaving the Meshify fan in place***
   * Two Noctua NF-14A's (140mm) for the front intake (largest and most possible)
   * Upgrade the NH-D15S to the performance of a NH-D15 by adding a NF-A15 (150mm)
   * I'd like to keep temperatures low for two reasons: 1) The room the PC will be in is small and I don't want to heat the room up in the summer 2) I'm kicking the can down the road on replacing my A/C and it's NOT the most efficient unit
* I don't want to spend a ton of time troubleshooting, and I want an **EASY** overclocking experience and I think the quality parts are pretty vetted for good overclocking results (RAM).  I know the power profile for AMD and Windows update hasn't come out yet, so I'm hoping there will be more headroom for Ryzen 3000 overclocking in the next month or two.
* I'll likely never go to watercooling just because I know those parts are more likely to fail, and I think I can hit near the same results with fans.
* An easy to understand and feature rich BIOS is important.

**Issues I had to work out:**

* My max height for a case is 19"" because of my custom desk.  Meshify seemed to flow the best, had the most features, etc
* The case's max PSU length is 175mm, supposedly!   I have a 180mm PSU.  Fractal said, ""Basically, if your PSU isn't prone to buzzing and you don't mind it touching the case, you can go well over 175mm without issue in many configurations"" so I should be good here.  I still have to mount two 3.5"" HDD's from my current build.
* RAM Clearance was an issue with a NH-D15 (limited to &lt;32mm) so I had to go with a NH-D15S allowing 65mm. The NH-D15S is a 1-3 degree performance hit, so I might get another NF-A15 or smaller fan for the front, which basically gets it back on par with NH-D15 performance.
* I might go with a standard color scheme on the NF-A15 fan instead of the chromax Noctua fan so the colors match (I hate the brown; but, they don't have the NH-D15S in black!
* Now that the RAM fits, I can go with RAM with a beefier heatsink... See the T-Force RAM 4000 MHz RAM
* I've been bouncing back and forth on a Gigabyte Aorus Elite and an ASRock Taichi X570; but, people tell me that the Aorus Elite's cooling is sufficient for the 3900x

**Looking for feedback:**

* Any place you see a build issue - Let me know!
* Will all the fans be too loud?  Current case is 45-47 dB @ the front
* Any thoughts on my RAM for overclocking?  I know 3600 MHz is the sweet spot, and supposedly lots get T-Force RAM and lower to 3600-3800 and run tighter timings.  My knowledge of memory OC'ing stops here.  There's faster RAM out there that's marginally more; but, it's mostly 1.4 or 1.45v instead of 1.35v.  From what I understand, 1.35v is the limit for this motherboard and 4000 MHz is the fastest supported.
* Open to any logic on my thought of going with X570 for PCI-E and getting a Sabrent 4.0 even though I don't really ""need to"" and just having the PCI-E ability for something later

**Thoughts?**

Amd,NancyPelosisRedCoat,39,3,"Help me pick a graphics card pleaseAs I feel like it's time to put my Geforce 950 Ti in a retirement home, I was going through replacement options but I'm really not sure of what I actually need. 

&amp;#x200B;

On one hand, I don't play many games anymore; nowadays I only open up Tropico 6 and Cities: Skylines but I do want to give Witcher III another try because it was just too much for my current graphics card to handle. I never play fps though and I'm fine with medium settings in whatever I play.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand, I am using a 4K screen so it would be nice to play at that resolution even if it means less details.

&amp;#x200B;

NVidia is out of the question so my options are:

&amp;#x200B;

RX 570 4GB  - $150

RX 580 8GB  - $225

RX 590 8GB  - $245

VEGA 56 8GB - $379

&amp;#x200B;

570 is the ""I don't play much games anyway"" option, 590 seems like the safe bet and Vega 56 is a splurge I guess. But I'm curious of what you guys think. Should I get the best card I can and not think about it not replacing it for a long time or do I just grab the cheapest thing and maybe replace it in a couple of years?

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go all PWM fans this time around and eliminate the controller and hopefully be able to sit really quiet with an oversize CPU cooler(biggest noctua or maybe the white Phantek's that's similar) that's able to passive cool or maybe run ultra low w/ the fans when I'm not doing much.

Do all 570 boards have custom fan curves or are some brands better about it than others?  Can they go into 0-rpm fan mode like modern GPU's and Power supplies have been doing for a while now?

Context:  I've been out of the loop on details like this for a while. I'm coming from an 8350 with a low-to-mid mobo.

So I had a x99 build that died right around the time I took a job across the country. As such, replacing a high end gaming PC was low on the list of important things to do.

But since I still needed a PC I bought a 200ge and an A320 board mainly for school work and basic home use.  I salvaged the psu, drives and an old 660 ti I had laying around and the build did what I needed it to do.

Flash forward a bit and we're getting the place set up and I got some payout from my last job. As we still need to do things with the house, replacing a gaming PC is still pretty low on the list, but I do want to upgrade the 200ge which brings me to my questions.

1. Will a 2600 work in a 320 motherboard? I don't really care if it's not reaching full potential as long as it's noticably faster than the 200ge.
2. Will a pcie drive work in that board if combined with an r5 or r7 chip?

The reason I ask is even though the board has a m.2 slot that is marketed as pcie, it doesn't work with the 200ge.

I know this is an enthusiast sub and people want to suggest higher upgrades but other than a better cpu, I don't need anything else at the moment. 

So with all that said, will a 2600 do the trick in this case?"

I replaced the cable with something else and it magically worked, eventhough the cable works perfectly fine on the onboard intel nic and a cable tester reports no errors.

After some troubleshooting i traced back the issue to an outdated firmware on the aqc107 shipped by Gigabyte.

Amd,kvsandro,19,1,"Any point keeping CPU fan at full speed on Ryzen 3000?Hello,

I have a theory that I want to check with others... So far I have had good experience with it and noticed no negatives.  


I have a Ryzen 3700X with Aorus Elite X570. It's in a Fractal Design Meshify C with good airflow and decent ambients. The thing is that Wraith Prism is extremely loud at full speed, and with Ryzen 3000 (at least mine) we see frequent peaks to 75C for example (which is still a safe temp) which in turn revs up the fan, and then in a second - revs it down when you hit around 60C. The factory curve is quite aggressive - 100% fan speed at 65C.  


My theory is that the CPU fan itself does next to nothing, considering you have a good airflow at the system, even spinning at 50% the CPU fan should suffice - the problem is with the heatsink, and specifically - the fact that 7nm Ryzen has much less contact surface.  


So what I have done is to change the fan curve, and set 100% fan speed at 87C - then there are a few steps, don't remember the exact settings (I've had many CMOS resets due to BIOS upgrades/downgrades and everytime I set it on memory) but for example I am at 60% fan speed when I hit 75C.  


Basically having a good airflow and medium CPU fan speed should be the same as full CPU fan speed as the problem is that the heatsink itself cannot conduct the heat so fast considering the reduced contact surface.  


So far I have been keeping track of temps, and I do get over 80C some times, peaking at 83-86C however these are probably quick peaks as I have not seen those temps when checking randomly, I simply see them at the ""Max temp"" column in HWinfo. I do get higher idle temps 60-70 however this was the same with the factory fan curve and from what I have read - other people also get 60+ idle temps - well mine isn't 100% idle as I do got a chrome running  with like 50 tabs open, and the different apps like steam/origin/hwinfo/discord... still nothing resource intensive.  


Are there other supporters of this method for ""quiet PC"" as I don't feel like spending extra 40-50 bucks just to get a decent cooler that will keep the same temps and just be ""quieter"" considering the fact that I can't get any OC out of this, and I haven't seen 90+ temps like ever.

Is running at 75-80C under load with ocassional spikes to 85-86 safe or should I keep the factory curve (or at least make mine a bit more agressive) although it does not seem like there's an improvement... I literally don't remember seeing any difference in temps before I set this custom, silent curve."

Amd,random_lonewolf,1,5,"Wrong CPPC Preferred Cores information might lead to sub-optimal scheduling.# Preface
I'm one of those who have noticed no improvement with 1usmus's new power plan. My best core (according to Ryzen Master / HwInfo64 6.14) sits unused, while the other cores getting utilized. I'm puzzled because I've already enabled CPPC and CPPC Preferred Cores settings as suggested by 1usmus, so I decided to dig deeper.

# How to check if CPPC Preferred Cores is enabled
Even if your BIOS doesn't have a settings for **CPPC** and **CPPC Preferred Cores**, they might still be enabled by default. In order to check if this is the case, do the following steps:

* Open **Window Event Viewer**
* Navigate to **Window Logs -&gt; System**
* Look for **Event 55 Kernel-Processor-Power**, there's should be 1 entry for each logical core. For example, my Ryzen 3600 will log 12 Event-55 entries every time the system starts up.
* Check the entry content, you've **CPPC** enabled if it says

        Performance state type: ACPI Collaborative Processor Performance Control
* Now compare the value of `Maximum performance percentage`. If this value is the same between all the entries, then Preferred Cores is disabled, and vice versa.

# Preferred Cores Information might be wrong

* If you have **Preferred Cores** enabled, then your `Maximum performance percentage` will vary between physical cores. However, the core with the highest value might not be the fastest one. For instance, the values for my processor are:

        Physical Core 0 (Logical 0 &amp; 1): 134    - HwInfo #6
        Physical Core 1 (Logical 2 &amp; 3): 137    - HwInfo #4 - Ryzen Master Dot
        Physical Core 2 (Logical 4 &amp; 5): 137    - HwInfo #2 - Ryzen Master Silver Star
        Physical Core 3 (Logical 6 &amp; 7): 126    - HwInfo #3 - Ryzen Master Dot
        Physical Core 4 (Logical 8 &amp; 9): 122    - HwInfo #5
        Physical Core 5 (Logical 10 &amp; 11): 130  - HwInfo #1 - Ryzen Master Gold Star 

 According to these information, my cores 1 and 2 are the favorite cores, but they are not the fastest.

# Conclusion
There might be a disparity between what Window considers **Preferred Cores** and what Ryzen Master thinks is the fastest cores. I don't know why this happens and which information is correct, but this inconsistency might be the reason that your fastest cores stay idle."

Amd,SoftwareDev44,9,1,"Finished my new 3600x build but it lags more than my 10 year old rig.So about a month ago I finished my new amd 3600 build and I’ve had some problems.

Symptoms:

 It will lag and drop frames to almost nothing when I’m playing a game like classic world of Warcraft.  (Which is not very cpu or gpu intense of a game.)

It will drop frames to 0 on occasion. I see no jump in cpu or gpu utilization when I’m monitoring. And it happens for 1-5 seconds then it recovers.  

I’m monitoring performance but it never gets above 50% utilization so that’s even more perplexing.

What I’ve tried:

Drivers, drivers, drivers. I’ve installed drivers multiple different times for the mobo and gpu.

Installing a different router and switch. I thought it could be internet related so I made sure to get a new cat5 cable and switch. Old PC performs fine on the cable and switch.

Disabled windows 10 p2p sharing. 


Here are my specs. 

Mobo: gigabyte x570 gaming x
Cpu: ryzen 3600x
Gpu: amd Rx580 8gb
Psu: 850w 
Hd; 512g ssd
Memory: Ballistix Elite 16GB Kit (8GBx2) DDR4 3000 MT/s (PC4-24000) DIMM 288-Pin Memory

I'm playing at 1080p with a mix of medium-low settings, and I'm only getting ~40-50FPS.  
I realize that this doesn't seem that low, but I can definitely tell the difference.  
The problem isn't throttling (there is a miniscule amount of throttling, but my framerate is already low when it begins the throttling. Throttling the symptom, not the cause).  
Please help, this game is incredible, but as I'm sure you're aware, constantly jogging between 40 and 60FPS is very noticeable."

Amd,RickSkz,19,7,"Gibabyte x570 / Radeon 5700XT issues with PCIe 4.0Hello,

I recently built a gaming rig which includes the following parts:- AMD Ryzen 5 3600X- AMD XFX Radeon 5700XT- Gigabyte x570 I Aorus Pro Wifi- Samsung 970 EVO 1TB SSD

The 5700XT's driver is the 19.10.2 version. The motherboard's BIOS, chipset driver and NVMe driver are all fully updated.

There's a problem, though:If I set the MoBo (through the BIOS) to work with PCIe 3.0, the computer will work flawlessly. However, if I set the MoBo to work with PCIe 4.0 or AUTO, then the computer will start to act up; there will be small audio and video stutters, and the computer will eventually BSOD on me.

I've re-installed every driver in my computer but the issue persists.

I know none of the parts in my computer use PCIe 4.0, but nevertheless it should be backwards compatible with 3.0.

Is this a common issue with this motherboard/GPU? What do you guys think?"

SSD: 120gb for the Windows
         1000gb for anything else
GPU: Radeon RX 5700

So after I put everything together, the pc started well, updated the bios, the windows, I got the drivers, seeemd everything goes fine.
First game I was playing on it, R6, everything went very well and smoothly. 
The witcher 3 runs perfectly. 
Later,
I tried Apex, it caused crashes continuously. Felt like my video card stopped working. I couldn't open and softwares connected to the video card. I tried the basic Radeon software, I just got on empty window, without anything showing up inside.
Restart, everything goes well again. 
Now I got the some issue with The Witcher 3, at certain point of the game, it get freezed, and my monitor turns off, and it stay like that. The sound of the game still going on, even the music. But no picture. This happens in full screen. (I'm using a display port to VGA convert cable for my monitor) 
In window mode the game freez the same but I'm able to turn it off, and the computer works fine, but still can't open the Radeon software, and I tried the Radeon overlay (Alt+R), not working. 

The situation now is, I deleted every driver related to the Videocard, 
I  updated again my bios, maybe I downloaded the wrong version last time. 
Right now I'm reinstalling the Radeon software and waiting for it to update.

I recently ordered a new GPU and monitor and wanted to get feedback on the complete build. I honestly don't want to upgrade any components since I just purchased them last November so I'd rather keep using them for at least another 1-2 years before I upgrade so what I have now could definitely be improved if I were buying stuff now.

Everything except for the GPU and monitor was purchased last November.

**For the monitor, I ordered Viewsonic VX2758-2KP-MHD (Freesync 1440p 144Hz IPS). which I got for $320 after paying hefty Ca taxes.**

I also recommended the 5700 as it keeps up with the 2080 in Resolve and Blender workloads, at half the price.  He said he wanted extra performance so he was keen on the XT.

So I was surprised to see him come back with a 2060 Super.  Turns out the sales reps at Canada Computer convinced him to get a 2060 due to the bad drivers.  They even showed him issues with the XT on computers there.  I have a sneaking suspicion the drivers they're using are out of date.

But to my question. I heard that earlier ryzen 5 models (like to 1600) had trouble with certain types of ram, is this true? Should I change my processor to a 2600 or 2600x to deal with this issue? Also heard that ryzen processors like better ram, so rather than 2400mhz maybe upgrade to around 3000mhz. And for a moderate pc build (like my intended one) for around $1000aud is a wraith spire cooler necessary, or can I survive with a wraith stealth cooler. And my final question, is the exact 580 a good gpu? Will this stand the test of time and pair well with my ryzen processor and asus vp247H monitor?

When I set the minus offset voltage (multi on auto - 34x) my CPU voltage will fluctuate from  0,994V to 1,131V and be stable at 1V running Cinebench.

Amd,Norekien,0,1,"EDC Issue on ryzenGood morning Everyone!

I'm encountering multiple issues when playing games that require some CPU strenght, for example, i can play league of legends with no troubles, but once i launch, Guild wars 2, Black desert online, Destiny 2, Squad or some games like those the game closes out, GPU tems are really good and doesn't go really further than 65ºC, however cpu gets up to 65ºC+.

&amp;#x200B;

I have noticed on Ryzen Master that my EDC is always on 100%, i have seen that changing the windows energy power plan settings to balanced commonly fixes this issue, however, i already have my settings as balanced on power settings.

*Processing img iazv86ihdvq31...*

https://i.redd.it/j5fn38rqdvq31.jpg

I have tried to set it at the low performance however whenever i click on apply and then accept and close the window it set backs to balanced.

I have not made any change on the BIOS as far as i know, however this issue has been appearing since really a long time ago but i was too lazy to try and fix it, i don't think GPU may be an issue as the temps on it are fine and the crashes don't reset the graphic settings on the monitor nor briefly shut it down.

I'm kind of worried not just by the fact that i can barely play games but because it may cause issues on the hardware on the long run.

Would this cause programs like CAM to report a temperature that's higher than what we can usually expect?

I've read that 110c readings are ""normal"" for this card. When running Furmark with a 35% fan curve I get around mid-80s in Celsius on my Gigabyte OC 5700 XT. I've done a few tinkerings with undervolts as well. So, is mid-80s considered a ""good"" temperature for this card?"

Tried removing the glass side panel and temps were significantly better (around 67c). I have two exhaust fans and two intakes with Kraken X52 in front.

I upgraded from MSI 1070 Gaming X, and never had any issues with temps before but it appears that Sapphire Nitro coolers are designed to push most of the heat into the side panel, which is too close and just reflects the heat back to the GPU.

Anyway, I would love to hear your experience with the card, and if you had similar issues."

I have just recently entered the AMD world and am so far very happy with my new setup.

What makes me want to smash my head against the wall though is that I cannot get my NVMe SSD  to run properly without my other components playing ""hide and seek"" with me.

The situation:

I plug in my new NVMe SSD and install Windows, all good. I install drivers and configure my GPU, all good. But then, as soon as I go to drive setup I cannot see two of my other drives.

I switched SATA cables, changed cables, and switched all kind of connections and all I get is that only two of the hard drives will be detected. Either in BIOS or Windows. That means 4 SATA connections kind of disappear, even though they are connected and receive power.

But as soon as I unplug my NVMe SSD all hard drives (SSD and HDD) WILL show up properly and function as they should - all 4 of them.

I have the latest F42 BIOS and all drivers properly, setup.

Ryzen 5 2600 should, afaik, support 24 lanes, 16x for my GPU and 4x for the NVMe SSD. The 6 SATA connections should not be affected as I have learned. Is that correct and how do I get my NVMe SSD to work properpy without loosing GPU power and SATA connections?

My 1600x is 28°C idle on an aircooler, hits 45°C during gaming, 55° during rendering, 62° during Prime.

I have seen a LOT of threads saying the 3600x is **45-60°**C in **IDLE?** And about **70°C+ in gaming?**

What is up with that, that's way too hot considering my 1600x temps. Is it because they're on stock coolers and stock settings that it boosts up to 4.4? I don't need 4.4, my 1600x is clocked to 3.9 GHZ on 1.27v, I would be fine with 4.0 GHZ I believe ( I would still see improvements over the 1600x correct? ) would that solve the absurd high temperatures?

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know about my first question and also **please maybe post your temperatures if you're on an aftermarket cooler, not the basic ones that come with the processor.**

Amd,MarHip,5,0,"Beeing AMD powered for over 6 yearsSo, this is my experience with AMD that I had over the years, my 6 year old PC is getting upgrades constantly. I started with an AM3+ Board. It was an old ASRock Board but I cant remember which one. I started with an AMD FX6100 and an AMD Radeon R7 240. This worked okay because I didnt use the PC that often. The only problem with this system was, that the used parts I bought really started to fall in performance after a year, the graphics card in particular had big problems. My Mainboard was fine but I needed a new graphics card. I bought an AMD Radeon Sapphire R9 270X OC that worked well. My next Upgrade was an FX8350 that I got cheap on a forum. I upgraded other parts like SSD, HDD and the Power supply, but I kept the CPU and GPU from around 2014 to 2018. A really warm summer was the worst thing for these every day used parts and the CPU couldnt hang on any longer. I was thinking of upgrading a year before but after all the issues I had with the  old system I knew it was time. I bought an AM4 Mainboard, the Crosshair VI and a Ryzen 7 2700X as a graphics card I bought a GTX1070ti. I had many driver issues with AMD graphicsl cards and a year after the big upgrade there is really no problem with the NVIDIA drivers. I also got from 750GB of total storage (250GB SSD 500GB HDD) to 3TB of total storage (1TB SSD 2TB HDD). Im really happy with my setup now. I left out my RAM and other parts but These arent AMD or a rival for AMD.

Amd,prizmaten,0,2,"AMD Ryzen 5 3600, help me to understand its behaviourHi,

My system:  
AMD Ryzen 5 3600 (using stock cooler for now)  
DDR4 Corsair Vengance LPX 16GB 3600 MHz (Retail Ryzen Optimised)  
Gigabyte X570 Gaming X (F3 BIOS)  
PSU Corsair RM 750W 80+ Gold

I recently purchased this CPU, after assembling the system I thought that everything works fine (can't tell as I haven't checked speeds, temps etc). Installed Gigabyte MOBO software, including EasyTune and probably unintentionally clicked auto OC to 3.8 GHz. Now, when I try to reset to default, CPU sets itself to 3.6 GHz, but after system restart, it idles at 4 GHz and gets short peak jumps to 4.2 GHz and temps spikes causing my cooler to regularly speed and slow down, very annoying. I could change fan curve to silence it, but this means constant high temps and shorter lifespan and it doesn't really solve the problem.

Setting auto OC on EasyTune sets it to 3.8 GHz and fixed the load and temps jumps, but locks CPU at this speeds, and no boost is available.  
I tried to fix it using AMD Ryzen Master, but when trying to reset to defaults, it idles at 4 GHz again. I also checked every power plan in settings, including AMD ones, they change clock speeds, but still getting crazy peak jumps.  


Btw, idle temps are slightly above 40 when locked at 3.8 GHz.

Can you explain how it should behave straight out of the box, and how to reset it properly. I want it to idle at minimum possible speeds when not needed and boost to 4.2 only when necessary.  
I know some people recommend to update BIOS, but nearly everyone reported that it doesn't help.  


I had no such issues ever before. It's like it's not reacting correctly to settings changes.

Thanks"

Planning on getting a new PC build and I'm kind of set on the R5 3600 + RX 5700 XT (probably the Pulse variant) combo. I would put those two with 2x8GB DDR4 3200Mhz, a 256GB M.2 SSD, a 1TB HDD (thinking about adding a 2.5 SSD later on), a Ryzen 3rd gen ready mobo (was thinking MSI B450 Tomahawk Max) and finally going for case I would go for Cooler Master MasterBox MB511 RGB (comes with 4/6 fans, planning on adding the last 2 later on).

Now the question(s). How much power will I need for the system? Was thinking about a Seasonic Focus 80+ Gold 550W but will it be enough for both the initial system (with only 4 fans, no 2.5 SSD), as well as the one including those?

I don't plan on OCing either the proc or the GPU.

Amd,VRocker88,34,21,"Suttering in some games with a 5700XTI've had my Sapphire 5700XT Nitro+ for a few weeks now, and while it's great in the games i play frequently, it's ragetastic in others.

I've noticed in Gears 5 and Dirt Rally 2.0 that the game 'stalls' every couple of seconds, and gets more frequent the longer the game is running. By stalling i mean, the game runs buttery smooth at 60fps, then completely halts for a bit, then resumes at 60fps. I go from 60 - 1 - 60fps and nothing in between. I've not noticed it happening in BFV, GTAV or Beat Saber so i was thinking it may be a DX12 issue, but Forza Horizon 4 doesn't have any problems and that's DX12. 

I'm running all my games at 1920x1080 and on the highest settings that the game will allow. V-Sync is enabled and locked to 60FPS. I have RIS enabled but the stalling happens even with that turned off. All other settings in the Radeon control panel are default. I'm also not using Freesync.

I have tried cranking up the resolution scaling in Gears 5 but this makes the stalling worse.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing i can see that may explain this is the clock speed for the GPU keeps dipping to very low values (6MHz) while i'm gaming. It does this in every game i play, including Forza, but i'm not noticing problems in other games.

It also only seems to start happening in Gears 5 once the VRAM usage goes over 3.9GB (according to Wattman), but once again this isn't the main issue as Forza happily uses 6GB VRAM without issue. I did think that it may be a hardware issue when i noticed that using more than 4GB VRAM caused issues, as i was a bit rough fitting the GPU and may have damaged it...

The driver install was a clean install (Using the clean function in the driver installer), but i haven't tried downgrading it. I also tried fixing the broken chill registry key but it's still stuttery.

Stability wise, i've not had a single issue. No black screens, crashes or any other problems. It's more stable than my old 390.

/TL;DR

Lenovo's website is not the easiest to filter down to only AMD offerings across their laptops.  And most I can find seem to be entry-level devices - that's not what I am after.

I get big discounts on Lenovo devices through work and made the mistake of buying a decked out ThinkPad P1 last year and frankly pissed at the sluggishness of non-Wayland Gnome.  Sure, dropping to 1080p takes care of most of it but the tearing/lag is still there. If I wanted 1080p, I would not have bought this device.

&amp;#x200B;

I ran the same passmark performance test on both computers and found that my home computer is superior in every way except for Ram. Overall momory test score for home computer is 3184 (97 percentile) while for work computer it's 3427 (99 percentile). Work computer ram is somehow faster in every category except for Memory Threaded test in which my home ram kicks ass. And Latency test was especially slow for my home computer coming in at 33 vs 23 for work computer.

I think based on the specs, my home computer ram should be much faster with higher clock speed and all so why is it slower?

I'm having some issues in making the stock fan on Ryzen 5 2400G more quiet over the night. The only way of reducing the speed that I found that if I go to BIOS and set the mode to ""Quiet"". However, when I play some games, I would expect the fan speed to go up making me to enter BIOS again to change it and it goes on and on.

My question is: is there any software I can use to control the speed of the fan? I didnt have much luck on google. (Tried amd overdrive - it broke my system so I had to remove it using safe mode :P)

If there are no suggestions, I saw that in BIOS there is a smart fan control mode with 3 profiles. One of them is quiet, one is aggressive and the other one is manual. Manual one requires 4 inputs:

* Fan control off
* Fan control on
* Fan control start value
* Fan control sensitive

Im pretty new to these so I'm not really sure how should those be set up properly. When I input the settings as they were 'suggested' after calibration, fan kept ramping up and down since the temperature was changing from 40 to 60 degrees.

Amd,DM_Red19,10,2,"Ryzen 3000 and # of RAM sticksI upgraded a couple of months ago to a 3600 and everything ram related has been a bit confusing as far as speeds and timings are concerned. As far as I could tell, all zen architecture is impacted heavily by the speed of your ram, at least compared to Intel (correct me if I'm wrong). Basically I want to upgrade to 32 gb of ram (for shits and giggles, not sure I actually need it) and I'm wondering if I should grab another of the same 2*8 gb kit I have, or sell that and get a 2*16 gb kit. I'm not really willing to pay the extra premium for the really good 3600mhz+ ram so I'm wanting to OC a 3000 or 3200 kit. So, does having 4 sticks make it harder to OC? I've heard it's more stressful on your memory controller, but does it really matter? Are there any performance differences to having 2 vs 4 ram sticks?

Tl;dr, 2 vs 4 ram sticks for zen 2?"

Amd,Eulye,7,2,"5700xt questions - referenceSo been doing a tiny bit of research into the thermals and noise levels of the reference card (which in Australia atm due to an ebay sale I can get for $560 AUD delivered or $381 USD). What i've found is that undervolting the card between 995-1095 mv against the 1.2v stock you gain anywhere from a 5-1.7 degrees C reduction in temperature and between a 1838-1948mhz boost clock speed.

Also gamersnexus on youtube successfully (and easily) replaced the thermal pad with thermal paste + 4 washers and observed an 8 degrees temperature reduction in his tests (should be noted that the software for both cases differ but the delta is what we're interested in).

My 5700xt reference comes in 6 days (still in the post) and i'll be doing both to my card but it's probably going to be a solid week and a half before I can share any results, still have to wait for a tube of conductonaut to get to me.

I'm asking anyone who has information from any source that has combined both tests and how amazing does it make the card? This is very much the wrong approach and it'll be wrong no doubt but in my mine a very very basic idea of 3 + 8 degrees reduction means an under load temperature of around 64 degrees with the fan curve set to auto around 2100rpm and around 67-68 with fans set to 1750rpm.

That's bonkers good thermals and audio with 1800rpm being 40decibels max, and for a $560 card (for reference the cheapest 2070 atm in the same deal is $792). I would see absolutely no need to go AIB if the reference really can be brought to this level by approx $1.10 in mods."

I'm on the older chipset driver because that is the latest version that would install the Ryzen Balance power plan. Anything newer simply removes the plan if one is there, or if there isn't one it doesn't add it, so I kept going back versions until I found one that installed the plan.

About two weeks ago I noticed my CPU temps under load were hitting 65C or above, and under no or relatively light loads the temps would bounce between 41 and 52C.  My system never did that before.

I ruled out the obvious factors, dust / dirty fans.. Nope still hitting 65+

Tried different fan and pump settings.. no change.

Since I couldn't remember which thermal paste I had used, or whether I ever put the Arctic Silver 5 I got for another build on this one, so I went and changed that out. Nope, no change.

So after reading a couple threads where the domit talk was of which power plans was the best to use, I decided to fiddle around with those.  Seeing there wasn't much I could do with the Ryzen Balanced, since the min CPU was already 5%, I decided to try the stock Balanced plan.

Set that up exactly the same as the Ryzen Balanced plan, and wouldn't ya know it, without even having to reboot the system, my temps dropped to bouncing between 31 and 41C while idle, and with max temps under full load no higher than 56C.

R20 results are 3483 multicore, 453 single core. The reviews and online submitions that I've seen shows the 3600 at least above 3500 and around 480 respectively.

That being said, I also did Geekbench and scored 7122 multicore and 1231 single core, which is nicely above the 1192 and 6865 listed on their site.

Then theres CPU-Z, which my 3600 scores 3956-4020 and 505 for multi and single respectively. They dont list a single core reference score for the 3600, but they do have one for multicore, which is only 3930. Dont know if thats an average across users.

The least credible score is Userbenchmark, which I scored a 91.2% as opposed to the 88% average, putting me in the 79th percentile.

Finally, I did a blender render of BMW and it completed in 5.11. They uses periods so I'm not sure if it's 5 minuts 11 secs or 5.11 minutes. (Either 306 or 311 seconds).

&amp;#x200B;

The fact that AMD has eliminated **INEQUALITY** and the necessity to fiddle around with your gear from the silicon space.

&amp;#x200B;

You buy a 3900x and you have no reason to tweak it for days on end and still wonder if its stable for everything you do or will be stable in a few years time and all that for 5% gain in performance, unless you love to tweak you couldn't care less for 5%.

5700XT same story, OC'ing will give you 3-5% gain in performance maximum, just buy it, plug it in and your ready to go, no extra fiddling required.

&amp;#x200B;

This might sound strange since i am talking to a large group of enthusiasts but it feels good to just purchase something and not have to worry about fiddling with it to get the performance you paid for, it just bloody works, everybody has the same, the point in tweaking is for 99% of cases completely gone.

&amp;#x200B;

Even Ram, get 3600 as advised and you are within again 5% performance of what you could achieve by tweaking to the maximum 3800mhz along with the endless hours of testing for stability.

&amp;#x200B;

And with the above they have also eliminated the need to buy over buffed coolers, AIB graphics cards and the likes. You buy for silence, not extra performance.

Disabling SMT helped raise Mhz at the end of the run by about 75.    


Now at the end of the run I'm at 4105 - 4125.   Thats a fair gain from just changing the cooler.  I got the Cooler Master Liquid Maser 240L RGB for $89 taxes in up here in Canada.  Great deal I feel.  I also notice my voltage at idle stays in a lower range where as before it would jump around much more, with a larger range.    


I cut my case temps by about 5c overall and my CPU is down 20-25c on full load.   I think this was a great investment. I also think this is what Zen2 needs....a quality cooler.  You only need to manage the spikes in temperature so that the boost algorithms don't panic and down clock to much to quickly.  If you can work remove that heat the new Zen2's work well.  If anyone is annoyed by their boost clocks get a new cooler!

Amd,MrWFL,12,7,"Ryzen 3900x boost speed dependent on RAM and/or infinity link.Hello all,

&amp;#x200B;

Since monday my 3900x was finally delivered. Happy with my purchase (that also included an aorus elite mobo, scyte mugen 5 cooler and corsair vengeance 3200cl16 ram), i decided to do a cinebench single core run.

&amp;#x200B;

Sadly enough, even with the most recent chipset drivers and ryzen balanced plan, the single core boost seems to always boost the second best core from my second best ccx. But that's next to the point.

&amp;#x200B;

When i tested this, my single core (not best core) only went to 4250 Mhz peak boost (in ryzen master). However, i than noticed my ram was only running at a low speed. 

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of experimenting later, i concluded that i had to use xmp profile 1, and manually set the ram clock speed (for some reason the xmp profile set the timings to cl16, but not the ram clock speed to 1600mhz). I also set the infinty fabric speed to 1600 Mhz manually, and left all the rest left on auto, without pbo.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the same (not the best core) boosted up to 4375 Mhz single core boost speed.

The scyte mugen holds the cpu on single core load at 55°.

I don't think any tech reviewer has done any analysis on this, and i would be curious if other people could replicate this."

Try going to AMD Control Panel -&gt; Display -&gt; Click on ""+ Create"" on the far right of Custom Resolutions -&gt; Click on the Refresh Rate and edit it to 70Hz and save it.  Double check it's at that resolution under Windows settings for it.

I can now use Aero , Vsync and Freesync without artifacts and no halving of refresh rate. Blackouts when tabbing out of a game are gone too so long as Aero is enabled.

Amd,DonYenko,11,0,"Need advice - Ryzen 5 3600 cooling and temperaturesHi, 

recently I have upgraded from 1500X to 3600 and noticed that load temperatures are unpleasantly high.

CPU cooler is Cryorig H7 (with uprated QF120 Perfomance fan, 2200RPM max instead of 1600RPM), case is NZXT S340 with Cryorig fans, 2x 140mm 1850RPM QF140 Performance front intakes, 1x 140mm 1000RPM QF140 Silent top exhaust and 1x 120mm 1600RPM QF120 Balanced rear exhaust. TL;DR - airflow is more than adequate.  


When I was using 1500X, Arctic MX-4 paste was applied in usual ""pea-method"", load temperatures with 3.9GHz overclock never exceeded 70C during AVX workloads. I did the same with 3600, but recently repasted with CoolerMaster MasterMaker Nano by using ""X-method"" since CCD is not positioned in the center - reffer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/ccrisu/ryzen_3000_ihs_orientation_vs_the_position_of/).

I am fully aware that idle temps are all over the place (I am using HWInfo64 that wakes and boosts CPU frequently), usually 35-45C with rare 50-55C spikes, but load temps in AVX workloads (Prime95, AIDA64) are 80-86C, which is too high for my taste, especially with everything except XMP at stock. CPU is running Auto voltage, Auto clocks, behaves the same with or without PBO (no AutoOC).

I am also aware that AMD IHS surface is convex and Cryorig H7 coldplate surface is also convex. This was not a problem on 1500X since CCX was in the very center. Is it possible that this is a ""huge"" problem for 3600 since CCD is positioned at ""lower right corner of the IHS"" - this is orientation when CPU is in the socket of course. Should I keep it as is? Maybe lap the coldplate? Or simply purchase a cooler with flat coldplate?"

* I mainly play 1440p/144hz and VR gaming, with Voip and Firefox opened. Would I benefit from a 3700x instead of a 3600? Is 150EUR of difference worth it? People say new consoles will have 8 cores so that's why I should get a 3700x now

I didn't really see anyone with my particular issue, so I figured I'd make a post about it in case it helps someone out. 

Since it was a B450 board, I had to update the BIOS using an older chip (I used my 2600 for this) and everything seemed fine after installing Windows and drivers, etc. But when playing games or doing any intensive workload, the computer would crash. No warning whatsoever, just a restart. After digging around in the BIOS, I finally figured out that ASRock's automatically applied voltages for both the iGPU and the processor must be WAY too high. After manually clocking the cores at 4Ghz with a voltage of \~1.3 and the GPU at a reasonable safe voltage, everything works fine now. I tested both the newest BIOS (released just a few days ago as of this post) and the one that I updated to beforehand, and they both exhibit this issue, which seems odd. 

Granted, this is a lower end board, but it seems odd to me that it would have this issue in the first place at stock settings with nothing modified. Has anyone else wound up with this issue on this particular motherboard, or perhaps another one from ASRock or another vendor entirely?"

On my Asrock X470 Taichi with BIOS version 3.43 (AGESA 1.0.0.1, I think) both RDRAND and RDSEED both returned -1 no matter how many times I called them:

**RDRAND test: -1**

**RDSEED test: -1**

**RDRAND test: -1**

**RDSEED test: -1**

&amp;#x200B;

I just installed BIOS version 3.60 (AGESA 1.0.0.3 ABB), and now when I run my program I'm getting numbers that appear to be random.

**RDRAND test: 596498958042073559**

**RDSEED test: -4622723025460822824**

**RDRAND test: 7351274081626178590**

**RDSEED test: 2019643064880767672**

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't test performance before the fix (I figured it was meaningless). After the fix I'm finding that one call to RDRAND takes \~880ns with my stock 3900X. I'm not sure what the clockspeed is during those calls, but assuming it's around 4GHz, that would be about very approximately 3520 cycles per random number. So RDRAND is brutally slow (as expected) compared to both cyptographically secure and regular PRNGS. The benchmarking I'm doing is *very* quick-and-dirty though, so more rigorous tests could easily produce a different result.

Also, I can now install and boot Fedora 30 in a VM (Ubuntu 18.04 host), which I could not do before the BIOS update due to the systemd/RDRAND issue. So now you should be able to install whatever Linux distro you want, bare metal or virtually!

I don't play Destiny 2 and have no idea if Destiny 2 works via WINE or Proton, but if so, Linux users should be able to give it a shot. I suspect Windows users should be able to run Destiny 2 even without the updated chipset driver with the new BIOS, but I have no way of testing that."

If I were to leave the OCs stock, the CPU would be able to boost to 4.4GHz on 1 core, but if i manually OCed, the CPU would just stay at 4.2GHz all the time, therefore loosing performance on single core.

And would ocing to only 4.2GHz affect single core performance?

Side note: When using the MSI bios, and setting voltage, Override mode doesn't seem to work. I tried to set my voltage to 1.325 Volts, but back in HWMonitor, the voltage was only 1.1 volts, and only went down during Cinebench. Everything was stable though.

After some research, I'm reading the VRM on this board is weak. I dont really understand much on this -- Do I need a new motherboard to get the 3900x to work properly? I was using a Corsair AIO cooler. I can try the AMD Wraith cooler to move some air over the VRM's, but didn't want to waste my time if this wont fix the problem.

Thoughts? Thanks"

Amd,InternetOfStuff,0,0,"Ryzen 3 + ECC -- which mainboard to buy?Honoured Reddit hivemind, may I humbly ask for advice?

My question is: what mainboard should I buy?

I'm gearing up to finally replace my trusty Phenom X6 system. I looked at the receipts -- bought it in 2011. I increased the RAM, and stuck in an SSD, but otherwse it's been my production machine for going on 8 years.

I'll attempt something similar with my new system, so I'll go for something near the top end (have an order in for a 3900x, wish me luck), retain some extensibility, and am happy to pay a little extra.

I've decided I'll go for ECC RAM, just because for me the price difference is small enough to warrant the extra trust in a production machine.

I want a powerful box, but I don't need particularly fast networking, or many SATA ports, or gaming graphics. The machine pretty much fits the definiton of a workstation.

I was going to go with the Asus Pro WS X570 ACE, which even has official ECC suport (though I don't mind unofficial, as long as it works).

However now I'm having second thoughts. Do I really need such an expensive, super-new mainboard? With active cooling to boot. Would an X470 be good enough for my purposes? Something else? I'm happy to pay the &gt;300€, but only if it makes sense. 

I'd like to humbly ask the hivemind for suggestions for alternatives, ideally with some explanation as to why."

Amd,sapphir3flame,40,40,"RX 5700 XT impressions (ITX form factor and VR use)Among all the (from impression) high-end/enthusiast builds and reference cooler complaints, I'm chipping in with my experiences with an RX 5700 XT upgrade in an ITX build and some use in VR.

The build:  
MB: ASRock Fatal1ty B450 Gaming-ITX/ac  
CPU: Ryzen 5 2600  
GPU: ASRock RX 5700 XT  
RAM: 8GBx2 Patriot Viper 3733 (Running at 3200)  
Case: Thermaltake Core V1

First, to get some potential questions out of the way.

**Why did you get the blower with AIBs coming so soon?**  
Nothing beats the blower in looks. More practically, being an ITX case, dimensions - particularly the height - matter to me. From the announced designs, and from a little research into past designs from the partners who have not announced, all custom cards seem to be ridiculously tall, as in the coolers jut out way too much from the PCI bracket height-wise. 

**Why get a 3733Mhz RAM kit for a Zen+?**  
Slightly irrelevant, but here just in case. I wanted an upgrade for the previous 2666 CL19 set I had, found this cheap, thought it would be good to have it for a future planned CPU upgrade when the last of the AM4 processors come out, and the rest is history.

On to the card.

**Installation**  
For good measure I upgraded the BIOS to the latest at the time ([1.0.0.3](https://1.0.0.3)), set the PCIE to version 3 in BIOS, and DDU-ed before plugging the card. Installed drivers, made sure VSR and Enhanced Sync were off, and entered Wattman. UV to 2000@1050mV. Set a fan curve with a fairly aggressive ramp past 70C, then tried some games.

**VR**  
Coming from a GTX 1060 3GB, the most obvious difference is that everything runs absolutely smoothly beyond the minimum settings. Being on a Rift S with the Koss KSC75, I didn't notice any sound from the GPU except in Eleven Table Tennis when it somehow got stuck in loading a different environment and somehow managed to push the GPU past my ramp up point.

**Regular games**  
Like my VR experience regular performance was also \*mostly\* rock solid. No stuttering problems, and no instability except in American Truck Simulator in which it seems to consistently freeze within 10 minutes of playing. The freezes have occurred in both OpenGL and DX9 mode, but I haven't gotten to trying it in DX11 mode. I sit closer to the PC than in VR (of course) and use open ear headphones so I tend to hear most anything around me, but I still barely hear the GPU over ambient noise and even the CPU/case fans sometimes. 

**Windows 10**  
This is where things get weird. With generally rock solid stability in VR, only occasional problems with specific games but not crashing the OS itself, the most frequent problems happen when I'm not really loading the GPU. When browsing in Firefox, scrolling through images, or sometimes when just moving the mouse without interacting with a specific app, Windows 10 will just decide to freeze. No BSOD, no random reboots, but input will just fail, and the UI stops refreshing. When I have audio playing in the background it still continues as usual, so I think it's not a Windows lock up in the traditional sense, but a problem in the display driver. The confusing thing is this has happened with the previous 1060 before, just the 5700XT has increased the frequency to about once a day. With a different driver after a DDU, it kind of rules out problems with this specific driver, so I may have a problematic Windows installation that just hates the 5700 more than the 1060.

**Temperatures**  
To be honest I haven't been monitoring temperatures constantly, but when I did I averaged something like 68C core and mid-high 70s junction temps. I'm not deliberately loading the GPU with benchmarks and ambient temps are like 33C in summer here, so I have no complaints really.

So in conclusion I'm happy with the reference 5700XT. It hasn't given me a lot of problems except freezing Windows which I suspect may not be the fault of the card anyway, and I have my first LED GPU with pretty Radeon lettering in my case. It's the only thing inside that glows, so it stands out well."
Amd,mrmubot,29,1,"Stock - Precision Boost - Auto OC on 3900x.Hey everyone,

I wanted to know how many of you like/dislike ryzen master. I did some tests on all 3 modes via the ryzen master for my ryzen 3900x and the results were quite similar. Now I know this has been established by gamers nexus on YT but I wanted to reconfirm if this is ryzen master is the best way to play with these auto settings/auto boost.

Or if bios is the only real means? I have noticed that ryzen master does restart the system when a change is heavy. Otherwise,like, for example coming from stock to precision boost- it doesn't restart at all.

Amd,DoneFor2,19,1,"ASRock B450 Gaming ITX boot issueSo I just bought a new B450 Gaming ITX board that came with 3.30 BIOS. It booted up just fine with my 3700X so I then updated to the latest 3.50 BIOS. Everything was hunky-dory for my 3700X to my pleasant surprise. :) Several reboot cycles worked fine with \~18 sec BIOS post time. Then I started to mess with some settings in BIOS to my liking: 3200MHz XMP and fan settings, I think. It still booted up just fine. By now I was starting to long for faster boot time so I then I disabled CMS in BIOS. I also tried to enable Fast Boot at the same time but I only saw Disable and Ultra Fast boot options which I thought was weird, so I left it at disabled. But now boot has become very unreliable. Mabye 4 out of 5 times it doesn't post at all -- minutes of blank screen. Maybe 1 out of 5 times it takes a while but it boots straight to Windows with no logo or nothing. I now am thinking maybe disabling CMS is the culprit, but for the life of me I can't get into the UEFI menu! I went to Windows restart settings to make it boot into UEFI but it still boots straight into Windows (when it works after many trials).

I also tried to reset CMOS by bridging the two pins on the board with a metal object (I see no jumper cap) but it's still the same.

What did I do wrong??? :D"

I'm looking for a some advice regarding with my recently aquired 3800X. My temperatures seem very high indeed - idling typically at about 65, but under load typically in the low 80s, peaking at around 90.

The temperature was so high, that I have turned off PBO in the bios to try to help keep it down. I've also maxed out my CPU fan just to keep things down, which helped by just a few degrees. I'm using the Asrock X570M pro 4 on the latest bios.

Is this normal for a 3800X with the stock wraith spire cooler? I've seen complaints about temps/voltage but nothing as bad as this...

I've tried reapplying thermal paste three times, and the results are always the same. I've tried different methods of paste application (small blob in middle, the X approach, spreading evenly).

I'm at my wit's end - I've tried everything I can think of and I just can't seem to get the temperature down. I've built several PCs over the years and like to think I generally know what I'm doing.

Am I doing something wrong? Is there something obvious I might have missed? Or is it possible/likely that I have a faulty CPU?

Amd,nexusband,15,0,"Just bought an MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon - is the BIOS still garbage?After watching and thinking about VRMs (actually even dreaming), even though i have had some very bad experiences with MSI in the past (3 K8Ns that died in about 1-2 weeks of use, back in the Athlon days, a few MSI GPUs that have gone out with a literal bang...) - they seem to have the best VRM setup on B450/X470 boards at the moment. The others do not seem to come even close. 

I was and still am a very avid Asrock user - in about 20 Systems i build, i think i had one Asrock Board fail (FM2A88X Extreme6) - the others are still ""chugging"" along. I have gone with MSI on a Ryzen 1500X build and it is not as trouble free, as i'd like it to be. Still...i also bought a 3700X to go along with it and plan to ""push"" it and since i actually do some linux compiling stuff, it will be at 100% load for longer periods of time, so good VRMs was the ""main"" thing - ARGB the other. The Gaming Pro Carbon is the only one with an ARGB Header...at least in Europe at the moment.

So - basically, i'd like to know if anyone can shed some light on the situation, as i have found some threads talking about the MSI B450 boards, but they seem to be from the beginning of the year and with the 2000 Series. Is MSIs Bios still garbage, or is it actually not that bad anymore? 

I'd suspect i don't really have to worry about hardware issues, since they are using a lot better components...also, my Vega 56 and my RX480 are from MSI (come to think of it, i've bought a lot more from MSI than i realized o.O) and they are still working ;)"

Well the one friend is using the Crosshair VI Hero, getting a consisten clock of 4.3GHz up to 4.4GHz..   
Is it just bad luck for me ? Like did I get a 'bad' CPU or  did I miss anything ?    
It just feels weird since I didn't find any 3700X with such a 'low' clock speed.

CPU: Ryzen 7 3700X   
RAM: G.Skill TridentZ RGB 3200CL16  
MB:  ASUS ROG x570 Crosshair VIII Hero   


Did I miss anything important ? If u need more information feel free to ask.   


Any help is appreciated!

Amd,waregen,44,89,"AMD cards and multimonitor power consumption. Can we bring it to AMD attention? Cuz there is no way its necessary, must be some legacy stuff no one is touching.Amd cards reviews for years [looked like this](https://tpucdn.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-5700/images/power-multi-monitor.png)

As I understand, its because of the card going full memory clock when more monitors are used.

[Though some talk](https://www.tomshardware.co.uk/amd-radeon-rx-580-review,review-33865-6.html) is that if monitors have same resolution the clocks stay down.

I just dont believe this wasted power is really necessary. We have so powerful cards, how can they not drive two or three desktops at idle clocks? Or if they need some extra, why not make some mid step clocks or something. This feels like some legacy driver shit that just need someone with knowhow to focus and make a change here and there and it should be fine.

Current situation is that bigger the ram, bigger is the power consumption of dual monitor setups."

Amd,Bostonjunk,19,0,"5700XT and Carbonaut?I got a bit ambitious on Sunday and decided to replace the graphite pad on my 5700XT with Kryonaut. I used 1mm plastic washers to increase moutning pressure as well.

After I initially did this my GPU temp went down by ~5°C at idle, but as soon as I put load on it the hotspot temp shot up to 110°C - now, I use a way more agressive fan curve than most people would normally be comfortable with and with the pad the hotspot would sit between 85°C-90°C (this is @ 2GHz 1.08v - aggrassive fan curve.)

I was hoping to reduce fan noise more than temps really, but this was a disaster.

I took it apart again and repasted it - this time the hotspot temps went down and topped out at about 95°C-99°C. Better, but still not great.

After repasting AGAIN, the temps now top out at about 88°C-93°C - much better but still worse than with the stock graphite pad (this is under full load with 60% fan speed, constant 2GHz clock and @ 1.08v, ~30°C ambient room temp) - I'm assuming this is due to mounting pressure and uneven surfaces between the GPU die and cooler.

I wanted to give Carbonaut a try, but I can't find anyone else who has done this yet. I was concerned about contact pressure again as it's only 0.2mm thick. Also people saying it tears easily and a standard graphite pad I could order on Amazon would do better - but only theory, nothing solid.

Does anyone have any results of carbonaut on a 5700XT? I don't want to waste money and effort if I'm already getting as good as I can get temps-wise."

Amd,polski03,2,0,Need helping choosing a CPUNeed a recommendation. I am getting a new cpu due to me downsizing and the limited to no availability of getting a z270 itx mobo for my i7-7700k. I am not sure what to go with. I should also preface that ease of cooling is important for me as well. I mainly use my PC to game at 4k and do other casual pc stuff and am weighing on whether to get the new 3600 or possibly the i5-9600k only because when playing at 4k it is mostly taxing on the GPU so i don't see a need to get a better CPU such as the 3700x or i7-9700k. What would you guys recommend? Downside for going AMD to me is the need for better ram as all I have now is 2400mhz ram as it doesn't matter so much for Intel CPUs. Would the difference be negligible for me? Price wise it would be roughly similar as Microcenter has the i5-9600k for $219.99.

This is on the ASRock 5.90 BIOS on AB350M Pro4, with a 3600X.  I'm running an H60 (redid the thermal paste twice to make sure as well), which should be better than the stock Spire.  I just don't believe that this thing is truly idling at 46C one second and then 61C five seconds later, especially when Hardware Monitor is reporting 36C.

And before you wanna tell me I'm an Intel Fanboy, I'm making a small fortune from AMD stocks, ya'll should go buy AMD stuff and spread the word so I can make more money from this.

Now I'm glad I didn't buy it because,

1. Gaming performance is still a mess, Yes it's sufficiently good, but when I'm paying top dollar I don't want a compromised product, it should have top performance in every category (3900x / 3950x)
2. Max clock is 4.3 versus 5.0 on Intel side, huge gap. Whatever happened to ""5Ghz 16 cores"" hype? I would pay $1000 for 5Ghz 16c, but I'm not at all interested in 4.2Ghz chips. 
3. Chipset fan, plus mostly ugly crazy designs for MBs. The only reasonable design is the ASUS X570 WS or something, it's not cheap and it also has fan.
4. Ridiculous idle power, 2x that of Intel platform. Yes full load power is lower and that is great, but again, I'm looking for something that is overall better, not just better in some areas with significant tradeoffs.
5. IPC is barely any higher than Intel, with 70MB of cache, while Intel only has like 10MB. Sure as a consumer I shouldn't care how they got the performance as long as they have it. Problem is this tells me when Intel sorts out their 10nm shit, and they can slap in 70MB of cache, it'll kill Zen 2. In fact we know SunnyCove does kill Zen 2, they just don't have the fab to make it atm. But I'm not in a hurry, I can still wait for a true upgrade.

I'm limited on space so I was planning on using a couple of M.2 drives and a 7mm 2.5"" either SSD or HDD.

The board im gonna use (ROG Strix X470-I) says this:

&amp;#x200B;

**Expansion Slot:**

***AMD Ryzen™ 2nd Generation/ Ryzen™ 1st Generation Processors:***

*1 x PCIe 3.0/2.0 x16 (x16 mode)* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Storage:**

***AMD Ryzen™ 2nd Generation/ Ryzen™ 1st Generation Processors:*** 

*1 x M.2 Socket 3, with M key, type 2242/2260/2280 storage devices support (SATA &amp; PCIE 3.0 x 4 mode)*

*1 x M.2 Socket 3, with M key, type 2242/2260/2280 storage devices support (PCIE 3.0 x 4 mode)\*1*

&amp;#x200B;

\*1 The M.2\_2 slot shares with PCIE x16. When M.2\_2 slot runs in PCIE mode, the PCIE x16 slot will run at x8 mode.

&amp;#x200B;

The m.2 drives i want to use are: WD\_Black SN750 NVMe - Interface PCIe Gen3 8 Gb/s, up to 4 lanes.

&amp;#x200B;

the GPU i'll be using is the Radeon VII.

&amp;#x200B;

Will I face any problems/reduction in speed on the drives or GPU if I use both M.2 slots?, If so, Is there a way to use one slot as SATA so it doesnt take away the PCIE Lanes? Or if i'm using the bottom M.2\_2 slot, that will happen regardless?

Amd,eterrestrial32,22,9,"Should I buy a second hand Ryzen 1700?I was spending some time around the local computer centre and eventually ended up in the part of the mall dealing with used components. Came across one shop selling A Gigabyte AB350N Gaming Wifi mini-ITX board with a Ryzen 1700 for around 200 USD. Was quite tempted but didn't pull the plug since the shop said that he could just provide some ram sticks but I'd need to get a case and other peripherals elsewhere.

Fast forward a few days and I still can't shake it so was wondering if it really is a good deal and whether it makes sense to get something like that at this point when Zen2 is round the corner? A few other things that held me back were that the board and chip were literally resting on a shelf so wasn't sure if the accessories with the board and the CPU cooler were included or not. I could look into it further but wanted to hear from others whether it's worthwhile or just save up for a better pc once Zen2 is launched."
Amd,Afro_Superbiker,47,3,"Reasons to switch to AMD?Okay, so I'm planning a completely new build, and I'm wanting to switch AMD.   
I'm aiming for a mid-tier 1080p gaming rig. I've been told Amd is supposed to have the better value for money. But here in New Zealand, it's not really the case.

The RX 580 (4GB) is more expensive than GTX 1060 (6GB)

The RX 590 and the GTX 1660 Ti both cost the exact same yet the the 1660 ti is better. 

For the CPU, the 2600 is only $5 cheaper than the i5-9400F, which edges it out on single core and gaming performance, even if the ryzen is better for other computational workloads. 

&amp;#x200B;

So if the price per performance is roughly the same, what other advantages do I have by switching to amd?"

Amd,Sifusanders,27,32,"PSA eiswolf gpx pro 240 for Radeon 240Hello people,

Just wanted to warn you guys that from the 3 people from the German pcgameshardware forum who ordered the above aio cooler for the Radeon vii all three cards don't work anymore after installing the after market cooler.
All three of the users are competent and have installed other coolers multiple times so I want to rule out user errors.
We don't really know what has happened yet, but we reckon it has to do with too much pressure on the die (package).
No visible damage to the cards not two of the 3 are completely dead while as the other one at least works again, albeit after installing the Morpheus ii again.

Just be careful when you already ordered or bought it. For the other people who were thinking about buying it, I would would definitely recommend on waiting. 

Also worth mentioning, the full waterblock of ac also had huge problems already, I would be careful with all their products for the time being. 

Thanks, that is all."

Amd,Schnappi07,14,4,"GV-RX570GAMING-4GD-MI (for gaming should I flash bios ? some issues with maintainin core clock)Hey folks.

When I bought GPU 7 months ago I was satisfied. But then with Rivatuner I noticed that my core clock from 1244mhz is dropping down to 900-1000mhz during gaming sometimes. Then in Wattman I increased Power Limit to max and I had core clock locked to 1244mhz in games always. I gained over 10% in performance (that is not overclock basically).

&amp;#x200B;

I aimed for higher clock, 1300mhz is basically last stable clock now where I can game, without any fluctuations whatsoever in voltage/clock. I tried running 1450mhz, it runs almost stable, but in some games like new Tomb Raider I have some parts where gpu drops to 1244mhz and then it goes back (sooner or later), but performance even in benchmarks 1300mhz - 1450mhz is barely noticable or sometimes even worse by small margine (fps or two).

&amp;#x200B;

This is after running couple minutes in Apex with unlocked FPS

 [https://imgur.com/a/nlOtylY](https://imgur.com/a/nlOtylY) 

&amp;#x200B;

Also my Wattman settings for 1300mhz.

 [https://i.imgur.com/0G4Nfuc.png](https://i.imgur.com/0G4Nfuc.png) 

&amp;#x200B;

Setting states helps maintaining 1300mhz+ clock..

&amp;#x200B;

So now YES I'm satisfied with this GPU, but I don't want to upgrade until I see what will happen in \~2020-2021 with PS5 and how games develop. I would like to take my extra 50-100mhz cause it will increase performance a bit in upcoming heavy games. Should I flash bios or that will not help ? I feel like if I have larger slidebar on Power Limit I would be able to clock higher. 

My biggest concern is that I didn't see performance improvement with +100mhz core clock in games (I guess due to power/voltage ?)

I'm encvstin. I'm from Chengdu, China.

Recently, I developed ryzen TDP Unlocker based on ryzenadj, which can automatically identify your CPU model and then customize TDP restrictions.

Many manufacturer's notebooks have imposed strict restrictions on TDP, which makes the processor unable to perform its full performance, so we need it!

But what I'm experiencing now is that ryzenadj seems to be able to adjust only the laptop processor, not the desktop processor.

Can you help me improve ryzen TDP unlocker?

I figured it may be good to ask on here, as so far EBay and Trademe (NZ edition of EBay) have been unsuccessful so far. 

I’m currently on the hunt for a reference cooler for a Vega 64, as the one I’ve been asked to repair is no loner usable.

Long story short, the solder holding the cooling fins to the vapour chamber unsoldered themselves due to excessive heat from a low airflow case.

Does anyone have a spare cooler I could buy to get the card up and running again?

Amd,Exostenza,56,56,"Amazon warehouse deal nightmare!So, I ordered an Asus STRIX X470-F Gaming for a very nice price from Amazon warehouse deals. I made sure it had everything in the box that it originally came with and that the warranty was still as if it was brand new even though the item was marked ""used - very good condition"". I was assured it was all there, inspected and everything, while the full warranty would apply. So, I bought it. It came today and inside the box, which looked brand new, was a 10 year old INTEL motherboard; the Asus P5G41M\_LE to be exact. The thing was covered in dust and so clearly NOT the right motherboard it was almost comical that someone had put an Amazon Warehouse certification sticker on it and thought it was all good. Someone clearly bought the motherboard new and put their 10 year old motherboard in there and called it a day. Amazon was taken for fools and then passed on their gross incompetence to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

No matter, I thought, they always have great customer service. After explaining the issue to a representative their initial offer was to give me a 20% refund and I could keep the board as is. I had already explained to them that it was a 10 year old motherboard for one thing and for another it wasn't even for my brand of CPU yet this was their offer. The gross incompetence continues. I tried to explain it to several other customer service reps and even two managers although they couldn't seem to understand what I was saying and their best offer was to return it for a refund. Now, this would be ok although the other motherboards on warehouse deal for some reason jumped up in price so once I am reimbursed I would have to pay more for the same deal. They said they couldn't exchange it because it was not their product except it was an Amazon Warehouse deal and there are others, just like it, on the same Amazon Warehouse deal yet they wouldn't do an exchange. 

&amp;#x200B;

In the end I got a return label and am returning it. I am not going to buy the warehouse deal one for more than I bought this one even though they are in the exact same condition because the price went up making it not worth it. I am putting this post up half to vent and half to warn people about getting Amazon Warehouse deals. They clearly don't have the ability to spot a glaringly different motherboard from the one on the box or even the ability to check the model number on the board before they go ahead and 'certify' it. Here is a link to an album showing the box and motherboard I got. In the end what did I get? Hopefully my money back and a half a day dealing with customer service, printing out a return label, and going to the post office to return the item. 

&amp;#x200B;

Usually I brush these things off as not a big deal but for some reason this one just really rubbed me the wrong way and the complete unwillingness to even try to understand the situation and offer a decent solution was the worst customer service I have ever experienced from any company ever.

Amd,binaryattack123,40,6,"Is it ok to lock (sorta) Ryzen 7 2700x clock speeds at 3.7ghz?I’m using the stock wraith prism cooler, and thus don’t particularly want higher temps when the cpu hits 4.3ghz every now and then. Kinda stuck with this cooler for a bit so I just want to control my temps, and also supply as little voltage to the cpu as possible.

So I’ve turned PBO and Core Performance Boost OFF in the bios, set the cpu ratio to Auto, cpu voltage to auto, and turned on XMP (my ram is 3200).

As per Ryzen Master, my peak clock speeds right now are 3.7ghz and they occasionally drop down to 2.2ghz (coz of the balanced power plan in windows, I’m assuming) which is ok with me.

I’m happy with the temps I’m getting with this configuration as the max cpu voltage is around 1.275V

I thought about undervolting, but I was like... “nah.. f\*\*\* it. Let the auto setting do it’s thing” ... since I’m new to all of this.

I primarily use the pc to game, AAA games mostly (ultra/high graphics settings), but I do want to stream games at some point in time in the future.

If I do decide to increase my clock speed, it will only be by me increasing the cpu ratio, and leaving everything else the same as mentioned above.

My question : Will I be able to get away with this config, or will I benefit greatly by entering a higher cpu ratio manually in the bios? The max that I would want to go to is 4.0 ghz. (Cpu ratio 40).

I’ve already tried entering 39 as the cpu ratio to see how it behaves. The only thing I dont like about entering a manual cpu ratio, is that it locks the clock speeds to that setting (3.9ghz) on all cores, and doesn’t automatically adjust the clock speed like it would in auto setting. I’m assuming that by doing so it starts to ignore the windows balanced power plan setting.

If I understand correctly ... higher clock speeds = more voltage sent to the cpu

I couldn’t find any benchmarks anywhere but due to budget they’re choosing between an RX 570, and GTX 1050Ti. The GTX 1650 is out of the question due to cost. 

Would I be okay foregoing CUDA support in Photoshop and relying on the significantly better computing power of the RX 570?

Amd,_rogame,76,43,"Thoughts on ZEN2 16 core ESWhen using the same number of dies/chiplets per package, the clock difference between the parts with 6 cores per die/chiplet and the ones with 8 cores per die/chiplet doesn't exceed 100MHz. For example : 

&amp;#x200B;

|SKU with 6 core die|SKU with 8 core die|\# dies/chiplets|Diff|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|2600x (3.6GHz/4.2GHz)|2700X (3.7GHz/4.3GHz)|1|\+100MHz|
|1600x (3.6GHz/4.0GHz/4.1GHz)|1800x (3.6GHz/4.0GHz/4.1GHz)|1|0MHz|
|1920x (3.5GHz/4.0GHz/4.2GHz)|1950x (3.4GHz/4.0GHz/4.2GHz)|2|\-100MHz|
|2920x (3.5GHz/4.3GHz)|2950x (3.5GHz/4.4GHz)|2|\+100MHz|
|2970wx (3.0GHz/4.2GHz)|2990wx (3.0GHz/4.2GHz)|4|0MHz|

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know about 5.0GHz, but If you expect a 4.6GHz 3700x , you shouldn't rule out a 4.6GHz/4.7GHz 3800X/3850x.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the leaked 16 core ES, I'd argue it's either a 95w or 105w non X part because of the near 1GHz difference between the base and boost clock. 

You only find such a big difference when AMD needed to fit a specific power envelope. For example : 

&amp;#x200B;

||Base |Max Boost|TDP|Diff|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|R7 1700|3.0GHz|3.75GHz|65w|750MHz|
|R7 2700|3.2GHz|4.1GHz|65w|900MHz|
|R7 2700E|2.8GHz|4.0Ghz|45w|1200MHz|
|TR 2950x|3.5GHz|4.4GHz|180w|900MHz|
|TR 2990WX|3.0GHz|4.2GHz|250w|1200MHz|

 I can't speak about the base clock, but in all the examples above, the boost clock was 200Mhz to 350MHz lower than the max achievable boost clock."

Amd,QwazeyFFIX,3,2,"Questions about Thermals for Ryzen 2600X on Stock Wraith Cooler at IdleI recently built a Ryzen 2600x/1660ti 16 gigs DDR4 at stock speeds 15-15-15-36. Mobo ROG STRIX B450-f  


Nothing is overclocked by me and is running on factory/out of box settings.   


I have done some reading on different threads and found a lot of different information regarding the Ryzen 2600x and some seem to contradict eachother so I am not really sure what the most current information is. Some threads dating back almost a year.   


At idle, using HWMonitor and the Ryzen Master tool, my Ryzen 2600x is reporting low of 32 C and a high of 47 C, ambient temp is 25c. Voltage from .8 to 1.46. Fan speeds from 1300 to 1500 rpm on the CPU, 1400 to 1600 on the case fans, which are 120mm be quite! Silentwings x 4.   


One post mentioned that this variation in temps means my case thermal setup is bad. Which I could see but my design is pretty standard/straight forward for budget-mid level systems. They also mentioned that these consistent variations will wear down the hardware faster then having more stable settings.  


 [https://www.evetech.co.za/repository/ProductImages/thermaltake-suppressor-f51-e-atx-mid-tower-gaming-pc-case-gallery-00017.jpg](https://www.evetech.co.za/repository/ProductImages/thermaltake-suppressor-f51-e-atx-mid-tower-gaming-pc-case-gallery-00017.jpg)   


Two 120mm intake fans at the front, one exhaust fan at the rear and one exhaust at the top. Max temp under load, prime95 and cinebench is 76C which I believe is pretty standard with this type of aircooling setup.   


Another thread said that these variations are completely normal at idle, that the Ryzen 2600x will overclock itself if it has room to.   


My main goal with this system is stability and longevity with a near 24/hr up time and a 3 year lifespan. Would it be better to create a more locked voltage profile for the Ryzen? Or keep everything at default/auto as I have it now?  


Thank you for your time!"

As I was about to add this to my part list I noticed that Powercolor Red Dragon RX 590 was available for £10 more with seemingly much higher clocks but as I understand it these are basically the same cards so given the Nitro+ should have a better cooler on it would I be able to match the RX 590 performance with overclocking (provided my case has enough airflow etc..)?

I tested my Team Dark Pro 16gb (2x8) kit of DDR4 3200 CL14 in Rainbow Six Siege with my 1700X at 3.9GHz to test how tweaking the subtimings can positively impact framerate, in a surprising amount. I used the in-game benchmark for Siege to record my runs but I used MSI Afterburner to record the framerate. I was running at 720p low settings because I have a 1070 Ti and I wanted to make my 1700X the bottleneck. For the first set of runs, I set this kit at the default 3200MHz XMP profile that my ASRock X370 Taichi sets when I selected it.

If that is the case, **please don’t**. Unless you are OK with losing the T-shirt and games that are expected to come with it. 


As it turns out, AMD marketing is too short-sighted to realize that there would be people buying this CPU with the intent to keep it unopened as a collectible, and expect you to install the CPU before you can claim either the games or the t-shirt.


Really, AMD? If I intended to buy this chip for a PC build, it literally makes no sense to go for the “special edition” chip vs, the regular 2700X - you would save yourself $70-80 (possibly more if you keep up with sales) and still get the games. These games are valued at $139 before tax (as per Newegg.com) - so you’re effectively overpaying by ~$210 for the 2700X Gold Editiion if you buy it as a collectible, since you can’t even redeem the games. 


I previously posted about this on AMDHelp here and opened a support case with AMD to explain my situation. Yet, after providing them with all the receipts they needed to prove that I purchased this CPU, all they can tell me is that it sucks to suck and I am shit out of luck.

But Relive actually works on Raven Ridge, currently there is two options to get it working:

1) Get the old amddvr64 file and install it, this works, but since AMD stopped providing the dvr file separately, you can only install a old version, and im not sure for how much time it will work.

2) Install the drivers AND Relive with a supported dGPU or APU, then remove it and let the Raven Ridge APU, Relive is still installed and working. Until the next driver update.

So I've a bit of a strange issue. My second monitor, a LG27uk650 when hooked up to my Radeon VII randomly will have connection issues with quick flashes of green on the monitor. This ONLY happens when hooked up to my Radeon VII. My Radeon VII has 0 issues when only 1 monitor is hooked up however, as that has been the case for the majority of the cards life since I've had it. Only recently has it been doing this since I bought a second monitor to pair with the card. I've tested the new monitor for hours on end with consoles, other computers, and there are 0 connection issues when paired with those, so I've singled it out to my GPU. Has anyone else experienced an issue similar to this? Could it be an issue with the GPU in need of returning?

Amd,Chorss,41,14,"2990wx and RAM confusion. 4x16 or 8x8 ? B-die ? Advice needed.Hello guys

&amp;#x200B;

My 1st AMD build in past 3 decades is 2990wx. I bought this CPU in november 2018. Its sitting in Aorus x399 Extreme. Before i had Intel I7 5960x. When i built Threadripper machine last year i used 32GB ram from my old workstation (4x8GB). Memory is **Kingston 2666 CL15 ( HX426C15FBK4/32 ) .** As you can see, memory is CL15 but its running as CL16.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the pic from Aida 64 mem benchmark :  [https://i.gyazo.com/601aae3526adb84d2d78246dbe5d449b.png](https://i.gyazo.com/601aae3526adb84d2d78246dbe5d449b.png)

&amp;#x200B;

First thing i noticed after i installed all 3D software and stuff i need for my work that AMD machine isnt as ""snappy"" and fluid as my 5960x was. On my old machine i was able to work in PS with 5k res PNG images, applying filters, watching videos on youtube on my 2nd monitor while having MMO game in tray and rendering 5k res renders. Windows was smooth, certain tasks took longer but i never had that ""unresponsive"" feeling i have with AMD.

&amp;#x200B;

Weird thing is that in Cinebench R15 im getting 5000-5155 points randomly, sometime 4800-4900 while other people on youtube or while watching various tests and benchmarks achieved up to 5500pts on stock *(my temps are 55C on noctua cooler so heat is not issue here)*

&amp;#x200B;

With 2990w machine, everything feels a bit laggy/unresponsive/""bottlenecked"" if i do lot of things at once. If im rendering 5k image in 3DS Max, swapping between applications or back to tab with youtube video opened takes 1-2s, sometime video drivers crash and i have to reload that tab to get video again *(i can hear sound only).* Working in PS while having 3DS Max rendering in background is pain in the ass, my mouse will lag sometime, everything takes ages to open. Opera sometime freezes for 10-15s if i have too much tabs opened etc. It doesnt feel right and im suspecting my memory. Windows is laggy as hell sometime and im pulling my hair off if im tight on deadlines and i need to simultaneously work in 3-4 different softwares. Dont get me wrong, PC is fast, im doing my work 4-5x faster compared to Intel build i had before but multitasking is PITA. I even reinstalled win several times (drivers included) and Win is on SSD as well.

&amp;#x200B;

**Now my question is :**  im going to invest into new ram modules as i read that Ryzen loves fast memory but i also read that i cant run more than 2933 on my board. What kind of memory should i buy ? TR4 is quad channel and i want 64GB. Its better to buy 8x8 or 4x16 ? Do i need b-die if 90% of my work is 3D rendering in Corona and V-ray ? **I dont care about gaming performance.** All i care about is smooth , responsive and snappy multitasking and overal peformance without freezes and lags while alt tabbing between applications. Im pretty sure 2k euro worth CPU should be able to this without any issues.

Is worth spending money on 3200 CL14 memory compared to 3200 CL16 ? Do i need 3400 or 3600 in case of AGESA updates ? I can get 3200 CL16 4x16 kit for around 400euro. Going to CL14 can boost price up to 800e. Is that even worth for me ?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks a lot for your advices."
Amd,jreaper7,35,12,"G12 Bracket Install Guide (Vega 56/64)Do not attempt unless you are familiar with tools and modification. This will void your warranty.

What you'll need


nzxt g12 kracken bracket

thermal paste (I used noctua nt-h1)

92mm fan (the one supplied with the bracket isn't of the best quality)

240mm+ aio (must be asetek 5th gen)

CPU aio backplate for Intel (preferably metal)

drill

dremel

6: 2.5m nuts for the backplate

4: 3m x 25mm screws

4: 3m nuts

8: 3m flat washers

23: 8.8mm x 8.8mm heatsinks

1: thermal adhesive tape sheet (small square of it)


take the cooler off of the card, obviously. best way to line the holes up to drill out the CPU aio backplate would be to line the holes up with the vapor chamber or the bottom of the cooler shroud. mark them with something. then use the drill to make the holes one size bigger than the screws. I believe I used a 5/32nds bit. cut off the excess of the tabs on the CPU bracket. grind down the sharp bits.


bore out the existing holes on the g12 bracket, extending the existing holes to the inside of the mount for the aio water block. just hold up the CPU bracket to the top of the g12, you'll see how much you need to bore out. 


once done, add the heatsinks to the mosfets and power chokes. just use the underside of the blower shroud as a reference to where to stick the heatsinks. wherever there is thermal tape, you'll want a heatsink. the aio will cover the top 2 power chokes in the center of the top, so don't add heatsinks to those two. all others will be able to be covered.


at this point, test fit the aio on the card, make sure everything lines up and that it'll all go together well. 


apply thermal paste to the GPU chip. SPREAD IT OUT OVER THE ENTIRE CHIP EVENLY! do not use the drop method or lines. I guarantee you will not fully cover the chip. 


I recommend placing the card in the pcie slot at this point, makes installation of the water block a lot easier. hold two screws with washers in the bracket while lining the holes up for the CPU backplate. put the nuts and washers on loose, you'll need the space. once it's installed on the GPU, put your remaining screws, washers and nuts in, loose. now grab the water block and put it on the bracket. this is why we left it loose, you need the space in order to get the water block to twist into the tabs on the bracket. MAKE SURE IT IS LINED UP WITH THE HOLD TABS ON THE BRACKET! start tightening down the nuts in an alternating fashion as you would on a cpu cooler. now grab a m5.5 nut driver and tighten down until the nuts feel tight. DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN! just make sure they feel snug. plug the aio power connector to your CPU fan header. if one is not available, plug it into a fan header directly on the motherboard to control the pump speed through your bios. once everything looks good. move on to connecting power. you will need to cut off the left power cable's lock tab in order to install it. it'll hit the bracket otherwise. take the hold off piece of foam that was supplied with the g12, and apply it to the bracket right next to the left side power cable to make the bracket sit level. 


turn the computer on. once booted, open your monitoring software. if your thermals are high, you might need to tighten the bracket to adjust your tension. 


for reference, mine idles at 20c with an ambient temp of 72 degree fahrenheit. once you feel good with your thermals, now it is time to adjust your overclocking. while stress testing, make sure to pay the most attention to your vdcc and mvdd temps, those will be the most important with this set up. these temps are for your power delivery and as such, will cause you the most trouble if overheated… as the GPU and hbm temps will never be a problem again. I highly recommend using a overclock that keeps these temps under 82c in continuous load situations.


mine is set and fully stable at:


1682mhz at 1050mv GPU chip

1125mhz at 1000mv hbm


Max temp after 6 hours in division 2 running 1440p ultra at 120hz:

43c GPU

46c hbm

65c hot spot

75c vdcc 

68c mvdd"

Unafortunately i dont have a freesync monitor, i have a cheap ips 60hz one, so i wanted help to decide what software/technology i should use on the following cenarios to avoid stutter/tearing in each of those cenarios:

1. Ultra high FPS games (like CS:GO, 200-300 fps). Input lag should be the lowest possible, uncapped framerate, but less tearing would be appreciated. Currently im not using anything at all.

2. Games that i want to run at 60 FPS but stutter like hell and vsync is unplayable(like Path of exile). Less Input lag is appreciated but priority is free tearing experience. The game drops to 30 fps all times so i dont know if there is a optimal thing to to here. Im using chill to cap at 60 fps, because some games runs at high fps but only have several frame drops even without capping, so i cap to keep gpu cooler

3. Games that i want to run at 60 fps and runs stable(division 2,dmc 5). Priority is to remove tearing and keep stability, but less input lag is also appreciated. For those im using vsync, but i found the occasional frame drops to 55-59 fps to be quite annoying with Vsync on because it looks like 30 fps when it happens.

Amd,SuspiciousTurnover5,6,0,"Zen 2 RAM and motherboardMy current main system (based on Ivy Bridge) is having starting to have some pretty significant and strange problems that I've narrowed down to either the motherboard or CPU. Not a big deal since I wanted to get a Ryzen since they came out, however the timing is pretty awkward with Zen 2 coming out in a few months.

I am thinking about getting a current-gen AM4 motherboard and the cheapest possible used Ryzen CPU in order to last me till Zen 2 drops. When it does, I want to get that sexy 16 core version.

I don't know a lot about VRMs and such, but I understand that a 16 core CPU will probably be pretty demanding. I don't really care about overclocking or any of the differences between the AM4 chipsets, but from what I can tell the best RAM speeds and VRMs will probably be on an X470 board. Is that right?

Also I'm a little confused about RAM speed in general. I understand Ryzen wants fast RAM, so I'm looking at Samsung B-Die 3200MHz/CL14. I believe the best option for performance would be 2x8GB. Is anything known about Zen 2 yet as far as RAM configuration goes? I would rather have 64GB of slightly slower memory but that comes with a pretty stiff overhead on the current AM4 boards. Will that most likely also be the case with Zen 2?

Thanks"
Amd,panchovix,0,0,"Share your Cinebench R20 Scores!Hi there guys, I wanted to make this activity to you, to compare the same CPUs of the subreddit, and if there's enough results, to make an average list of each CPU to see what would be the expected score for a CPU.

Remember that there's 2 ways to run the Cinebench R20, if you give it real time priority in task manager, it will freeze your PC for some minutes but will give more score at the end of the test; if not it won't freeze the PC and it will give sightly lower scores.

So for my case, a Ryzen 5 2600X, these are my scores:

* Multicore: 3112
* Single Core: 425

Here are [the pics for reference.] (https://imgur.com/a/KlEVokI)

This is with everything stock, and 3066Mhz RAM (I don't know if the RAM speed affects much here)

We're giving you an opportunity to start reporting some of your AMD-related technical issues right here on /r/AMD! Below is a guide that you should follow to make the whole process run smoothly. Post your issues directly into this thread as replies. **All other tech support posts will still be removed, per the rules; this is the only exception.**

----------------------------------------------------

##Bad Example (don't do this)

&gt;  
bf1 crashes wtf amd

________________________________________

##Good Example (please do this)

&gt;Skyrim: Free Sync and V Sync causes flickering during low frame rates, and generally lower frame rates observed (about 10-30% drop dependant on system) when Free Sync is on
 
&gt;  
##System Configuration:  
**Motherboard:** GIGABYTE GA-Z97 Gaming GT  
**CPU:** Intel i5 4790  
**Memory:** 16GB GDDR5  
**GPU:** ASUS R9 Fury X  
**VBIOS:** 115-C8800100-101 [^^How ^^do ^^I ^^find ^^this?](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001309.htm)  
**Driver:** Crimson 16.10.3  
**OS:** Windows 10 x64 (1511.10586) [^^How ^^do ^^I ^^find ^^this?](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system)

&gt;
##Steps to Reproduce:  
1\. Install necessary driver, GPU and medium-end CPU  
2. Enable Free Sync  
3. Set Options to Ultra and 1920 x 1080 resolution  
4. Launch game and move to an outdoor location  
5. Indoor locations in the game will not reproduce, since they generally give better performance  
6. Observe flickering and general performance drop  
&gt;
##Expected Behavior:
Game runs smoothly with good performance with no visible issues

&gt;
##Actual Behavior:
Frame rate drops low causing low performance, flickering observed during low frame rates

&gt;
##Additional Observations:

&gt; Skyrim has forced double buffered V Sync and can only be disabled with the .ini files  
To Disable V Sync: C:\Users""User""\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\Skyrimprefs.ini and edit iVSyncPresentInterval=1 to 0  
1440p has improved frame rate, anything lower than 1080p will lock FPS with V Sync on  
Able to reproduce on i7 6700K and i5 3670K system, Sapphire RX 480, Reference RX 480, and Reference Fiji Nano

But about two days ago that changed. Now it's clocking seemingly random values, going 302 - 659 - 855 - 1012 - 953 - 789 and so on. It seems dependent on load and I can't notice any fps drops, running BFV at 75 fps on Ultra 100% of the time for example. When I put a lot of load on it (benchmarks), it's going to 1049 mhz and stays there.

What went wrong? Did I mess up any setting? Broken driver? Any ideas?"

I'm looking to make the most out of my monitor with settings at the max resolution (2560 x 1440), setting on most (if not all games to Ultra), and get get the max 75 FPS refresh rate. When I get frame rate drops, it looks like my CPU is pegged at 100%. My graphics card appears to stay at around 85% utilization. I thought about just upgrading the GPU. This is probably a dumb question but would a higher quality graphics card (looking to switch to AMD to take advantage of FreeSync) deliver the performance I'm looking for or are there other factors to consider. 

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I asked is because while talking to one of my friends, he didn't recommend getting a better video card than what I have now to offload processing usage from the CPU to GPU. I guess I'm just looking for validation and suggestions from you guys.

Amd,Xenot23,0,1,"Ryzen 5 2600x high tempsHi Reddit!

I recently built a new pc with the heart of it being a Ryzen 5 2600x CPU. I'm fascinated by the power of this chip and I couldn't be happier with it.

However I'm a bit worried about the temperatures. I'm using the Wraith Spire cooler that came with it and I get about 48-56 degrees idle with 25-26 celsius room temperature. I've set PBO to auto and it boosts to 3900-4000Mhz in games but it gets pretty hot about 68-75 degrees while the usage rarely goes above 40%. I have set up a custom curve for the case fans and the cpu fan in bios where the cpu fan works a 100% on 70 degrees which can be quite loud.

The case I'm using is the CM MasterBox MB520 RGB with two additional fans on top to get the hot air out. I don't think the airflow inside the case is bad because the GPU shows pretty good temps (60-65 degrees).

I'm worried about the lifespan of the chip with temps like that.  
My questions are:  
1. Are these temps normal with the wraith spire or is it possible that I installed it wrong?  
2. Should I replace the pre-applied paste with better?  
3. In the bios when setting up fan curves should I choose DC or PWM?

Thank you for the answers."

&amp;#x200B;

**AMD**

Q4 2018 Earning Reports - AMD achieves Revenue Target of $1.42 Billion.

*Naturally, the Shareholders and the Markets were very happy with AMD's accuracy forecasting future revenues.* 

&amp;#x200B;

**NVIDIA**

Q4 2018 Earning Reports - Nvidia missed revenue targets by $500 million, projected revenue of $2.7 billion ended up with $2.2 Billion of revenue.

*Naturally, the Shareholders and the Markets where very unhappy with Nvidia inability to forecast their own revenues streams.*

&amp;#x200B;

These are HARD FACTS because due to ficial regulations (statutory laws) Earning Reports to Shareholders and Markets must be accurate and reflect the realities of the businesses successes or failures.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, John Peddie Research publishes AIB Q4 2018 AIB GPU Shipments.

&amp;#x200B;

And, John Peddie is claiming that their research is showing the opposite effect of the HARD FACTS. 

&amp;#x200B;

Q4 2018 AIB GPU Shipments

Nvidia = 81.2%

AMD = 18.8%

&amp;#x200B;

Naturally, when a company misses its revenue targets for a quarter by 18.5%, you don't expect them to see any kind of market share gain in AIB GPU Shipments, because the AIBs would go bankrupt ordering an extra $500 million in inventory they were unable to sell.

Amd,Won_Doe,16,1,"Seemingly unfixable RX480 issue: decreased performance / crashing. Is it hardware damage?Left The Witcher 3 running:

https://i.imgur.com/DPL6ous.jpg

- Every game has reduced performance. 

- If the action is hectic enough to cause bigger FPS drops, there's a chance of entire PC ""crashing"" to a black screen; no blue screen, no restart, and there seems to be no related Event Viewer logs.

- Yes, I've uninstalled/reinstalled/DDU'd several different drivers, many times. 

- I've monitored temps and they were fine. PC case air still feels cool.

In January, I was experiencing very random, often non-frequent crashing with Event Viewer showing that the AMD display driver stopped worknig. That was an entirely different issue and was fixed when I later realized that like a fool, I somehow didn't have the GPU seated in all the way. Pushed it in all the way and the crashing stopped BUT, Monster Hunter World seemed to have taken a performance hit. I attributed that to it being a mediocre port. I remember Overwatch seemingly being fine as I logged on in Feb during an event. Memory and events get a bit hazy from here but MHW started crashing when FPS dips were high. Attempted to trouble shoot at somewhere during that, it seemed that every one of my games was experiencing some sort of stutering/FPS drops even with very little going on. Overwatch often crashes at the main menu if I'm there for around a minute or so. Lowering settings, specifically the Resolution Scaling (taking it off Automatic), seems to make it stable enough to play.

**TL;DR: GPU wasn't fully seated, caused random crashes (not sure for how long). Reseated, big FPS drops in MHW. Issue later affected all my games and it seems that my GPU just isn't performing as it should.**

Since then I got very invested in the gpu market and was thrilled seeing the benchmark results for the Radeon VII.

My question now is:

I am thinking about upgrading my rig and I am not quite sure with which components.

From as far as I understood AMD is going to be releasing new cpus soon but the NAVI gpu cards will only release mid 2019.

Moreover I am not quite sure if the Radeon VII is going to be the flagship model for this generation or if a new flagship model is going to be released in 2020.

TLDR: Will the Radeon VII be the flagship model for more than one year or should I wait one more year and get the next NAVI flagship model (if there is going to be one).

2200G, little tower cooler with heatpipes, basic Gigabyte B450, 8GB 3000 MHz kit, 240GB M.2 SSD, 1 TB HDD, quality 400W PSU and a regular cheap case all for 350€ and nicely upgradable. I don't want to spend more really.

Now people are telling me to take the 2400G because it's more future proof due to HT. It's 45% more than the 86€ 2200G at 125€ here atm which makes it more compelling than 70% more at launch but a full fledged 1600 costs the same. And a 2600 is just 150€ now.

So I'm wondering about diminishing returns. There's always a reason to choose a better part but for a secondary rig for non AAA gaming, price to performance is what it's about.

Would you spend 39€ more on the 2400G just for future proofing or would you say 2200G is perfect for a rig meant to run less demanding games and still worth having a dGPU added to it in the future?"

Power Supply: CoolerMaster MasterWatt 550

&amp;amp;#x200B;

My question is which parts can I keep and what parts should I replace (the feedback I got until now was either to only replace the Video card and replace the other stuff during the upcoming years or replace Video,CPU,Motherboard and Memory at the same time)?

&amp;amp;#x200B;

My first thoughts was only getting a RX580 (Sapphire Nitro+ 8GB). Will that work? If not, how can I make it work?

1. Is the Radeon VII capable of more?

Is this something we will see from AMD as their drivers evolve for the Radeon VII, or is the performance virtually peaked?

2. Optimization of games has almost always been driven by Nvidia as most systems use their devices; as AMD has begun releasing newer architectures and higher end cards, can we expect to see developers shift to a more balanced optimization, or will titles always be more biased to one team or the other?

3. I've seen a few posts regarding flashing the bios on the Radeon VII to Instinct (?); is there dormant hardware on the board that can be utilized by doing so, or is this more of a personal preference?"

I have stability tested the mitx build a bit and messed around, the overclocks are pretty freaking stable at these numbers. Now the 2600x I havent messed with a whole lot, but I'm getting stuttering on stock settings in games, it's really just running pisspoor and I dont know where to even start.

So, fine people of r/AMD, where do I start? This 2600x has less than 6 months of non OC, pretty basic use, then I upgraded my build. Did I just win the silicon lottery on my 1600 and lose on my 2600x or what is going on? 

Ps. I'm aware I havent provided a whole lot of useful info, let me know what I can do to help you, help me. I'm free all day for the most part, so I can run any tests or whatever on either of these pcs as needed. "

Amd,easysmoke,10,1,"Experience with using newest drivers on Ryzen Mobile and Benchmarks (Ryzen 5 2500U)Hi all,

I wanted to share my experience and some benchmarks with updating the drivers on my Acer Aspire 3 with Ryzen 5 2500U and Vega 8 Graphics. The vendor supplied graphics were at 17.7 and now I updated to the latest drivers as of this time (19.1 i think) using the Device Manager method (following a video posted on this sub). 

I realize that official drivers may be coming soon but issues with Youtube videos and an unexpected video driver related BSOD prompted me to try to update my drivers unofficially anyway. 

Overall I am happy to say that I have not lost any functionality. I am still able to enter and exit sleep mode and change the brightness, Youtube videos no longer experience artifacts and games tend to run better. 

  
Example: Had to run overwatch at 1280x720 before to stay near 60 fps now it can handle the native 1366x768. Resident Evil 4 has an annoying issue that the game locks to 30 fps if it cannot maintain 60 fps which would be frequent on the old drivers, now the game stays at 60fps most of the time. I dont expect any difference in other games that I currently have as they are mostly older titles which ran well on the old drivers anyway. I am still able to change the resolutions in these games, which is an issue that I anticipated based on previous reports, but thankfully did not encounter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Older games that run at a near constant 60 fps on this setup (1366x768):

Ultra Street Fighter IV (high settings)

Call of Juarez Gunslinger (medium settings, 60 fps with occasional drops)

Tomb Raider Anniversary (max settings)

Serious Sam HD The First Encounter (high settings)

Doom 3 BFG Edition (60 fps if motion blur is disabled) 

Elder Scrolls Oblivion (max settings)

&amp;#x200B;

The only difference I noticed is that the fans seem to be engaged more often but temperatures are still similar and I have not noticed any overheating.

&amp;#x200B;

Hopefully someone can find this information useful and try this method while waiting for official support. Keep in mind if you have a different laptop your mileage may vary. I would love to see more games running on this APU so please share any benchmarks. Cheers.

Amd,SandboChang,58,1,"Radeon VII as a budget compute cardIt maybe meh to some for its gaming performance, but compute-wise I can only say I am impressed by how much it has gained over Vega FE/46 so I want to point this out.

Probably by now most of us already knows the card kills it with a **FP64 performance of 3.5 TFLOPs**, something no matter how crappy CLBlas is, this card will offer you better FP64 performance over even 2080Ti or the so called Trex. The next card to get higher performance, not counting the used old Titans, will be the $2999 Titan V.

Then, if one is not interested in FP64, how good is its FP32? Phoronix did a nice job covering the missing part of most other reviews: Radeon VII's OpenCL/ROCm performance on Linux, and it gets real:

[https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=radeon-vii-linux&amp;num=9](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=radeon-vii-linux&amp;num=9)

Certainly in a few tests Nvidia still rocks, but look at how much R7 is faster than Vega 64, to me it is a jaw dropping improvement, plus given the price. Also, importantly, please look at the power consumption, very surprisingly it takes less power than Nvidia's cards in the compute tasks.

&amp;#x200B;

You may want to say they marketed this card towards the gaming market, but at the end it's a compute card in disguise, and we who wants a budget compute card can't be happier to see this."

As mentioned, we've been on these rigs for 7 years or more, and the only thing either of us has ever needed was a newer gpu every few years. Both of us are pretty excited, though honestly, none of these purchases were ""needs"" as much as ""wants."" Far Cry 5 and Monster Hunter World are really taxing our current machines, especially in coop/multiplayer (though Destiny 2 and Civ6 both run flawlessly), and Anthem/Division 2 betas showed these components' ages pretty quickly. Anthem was a bit of an unoptimized mess, and Division 2 requires a bit more than Div1 (which ran fine for both of us, but had to be tweaked quite a bit, even with my 1080). 

&amp;#x200B;

Really wanted AMD to give us an option for gpu, but the sad truth is that while the R7 released today is a good gpu, it's still too expensive, and the problem is that AMD has nothing in a lower tier ($300-$400) that is as good (or power efficient) as Nvidia's offerings. Was really surprised by how well the 2060 performs (read at least a dozen, if not more, reviews of various flavors of this gpu). From what I can tell, it's as good, sometimes slightly better, than my 1080GTX, at least until it gets into 4k (though seems to be as good at 1440p). 

&amp;#x200B;

Almost pulled the trigger on the new-ish 590, but it's just too old and still runs far too hot, and wasn't appealing. Looked at the Vega56, but it falls short of all NV cards in the same price range, and the Vega64 seems even worse for bang-for-the-buck value. Not only that, I built a couple of systems for friends with 580 and Vega56, and they were... good, really good for 1080p, but they just didn't impress me at all. Especially after lucking out and getting my 1080GTX for $400 (when everyone was selling them for $600+). But I REALLY REALLY wanted an AMD gpu, and I REALLY want AMD to finally compete with Nvidia in all tiers for graphics cards. I'm hopeful that down the road, when we move to either 1440 or better yet, 4K monitors, AMD will finally have something that will pique my interest (and won't run like a hellfire oven, and the drivers will be mature). 

&amp;#x200B;

But I absolutely, positively promised myself that I would move to Ryzen 2 cpus when upgrade time came, as I've been an Athlon man since the old Slot A and Socket A cpus. Extremely happy that Ryzen's second-gen versions are worth buying. And yes, I know that the i7 cpus are still king of IPC, but nothing we play nor any of the software I need for work is single-threaded anymore, and 6/12 or 8/16 is more than enough, especially once we get into 4K gaming (where the cpus all seem equal since the gpu is the main factor in performance). Also, since I spent a decade in the overclocking scene (especially while working for DFI), I have zero interest these days in overclocking, so I don't care that an i5/i7 could hit 5Ghz while the R5/R7 cpus have very little headroom. I'm old now, and just want to turn the computers on and get straight to gaming. Or work (boo!). 

&amp;#x200B;

The only major purchases left are upgrading from 1080p 60hz monitors to 144hz. Not sure if we'll get 1440p versions as the bump in price from 144hz 1080 to 1440 can be fairly steep, plus I want to see a few of the new curved monitors with my own eyes before I make any decisions. For now, 1080p is fine for both of us. Might even look at 75hz monitors, but when I built a new i5-6700K + RX 480 system for my friend, he got an Asus 24"" 144hz 1080p monitor and it definitely was better than our low-end monitors. But again, I want to check out the new curved ones, and I need a much larger monitor than 24"" because I also use my rig for work, not just gaming. We might even skip 1440p and go straight to 4K, which is another reason we bought Ryzen cpus. But 4K monitors with high refresh rates are just too expensive at the moment. 

&amp;#x200B;

Wife and I discussed whether or not to spend the extra to get her a 2700X cpu as well since we're both getting essentially the same core system (which makes troubleshooting a lot easier, as well as tweaking), but she only uses hers for gaming and web browsing. We decided that the extra $100-$150 difference in 2600X to 2700X would be better spent on the M.2 NVMe SSD, as I've seen these in action on another friend's rig and they are insane compared to the platter drives I've been using for decades (even my RAID-0 is sluggish and slow compared to a standard SSD). More than that, I almost bought 2x 2600X instead of the 2700X for me, as from all that I've digested over the last month while shopping, there's not a lot of difference other than minor clock speed, and of course the extra 2 cores. But for gaming... Meh. I no longer need to bleed myself dry to have the best, fastest, most powerful gear in the world. And, being old and cranky (hah, you thought I was gonna say ""wise""), I know better than most about the hazards of buying brand new, bleeding edge gear for premium price, only to watch it plummet in value in 3-6 months when the next greatest thing comes out (think of it like the moment you drive a brand new car off the lot and it loses a ton of value instantly). 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I still fretted quite a bit over the amount spent, but she just rubbed my shoulders and reminded me that it has been 7 years or more since I built our last systems, and we're both amazed that they've lasted this long, and that these new setups will be mostly future-proof for a while (expecting to only have to upgrade the gpu once in a while and maybe add in another SSD depending on need, though we have an older Intel Q6600 quad with about 4TB of hdd storage that we use for our internal house server, so only thing we really need on our hdd is games + my work software). 

&amp;#x200B;

Right. Sorry for lengthy blah blah blah. Just kind of excited. I used to work for DFI back in the day (LanParty motherboards for overclocking!) and was used to never having to buy anything. My 2500k and her i5-3450 builds were the last ""free"" bits I got before retiring from tech, so I probably did everything I could to keep them running strong, knowing that whenever upgrade time came around, all of it would come out of our bank accounts (instead of AMD, Intel, Nvidia, Crucial, Mushkin, Gskill, Corsair, DangerDen, etc pockets heh). Can't wait to get all the bits and put them together, as for me, building them is maybe more fun than sitting down and using them. I did it for 20 years, and though I still do it here and there for close friends or family, I really don't get my hands into them anything like I used to (12 hours per day, 7 days per week, but it was like a hobby I got paid to do instead of a job, though that job put her through college for both a BA and an MA).

Between factors such as cooling &amp; temps, noise, performance, and overall build quality I've heard a lot of good things about Sapphire, XFX, and Powercolor. Also read that the top-end Asus ROG Strix and Gigabyte Aorus XTR were good rx580 cards, but I think they're outside of my budget (\~AUD$370).

So far, I've set my eyes on the Sapphire Nitro+ Special Edition, XFX GTS Black Edition/XXX, Powercolor Red Devil, and maybe the ASUS ROG Strix TOP. What do you guys think of these cards, and are there any other better options I should consider?

Ram : G.Skill TridentZ 3200 CL16

Power : EVGA Supernova 550 G2


I was never intending to do anything crazy with the 2700x, hence the stock cooler. I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly. Can someone help me with...

1)  Changing settings via Ryzen Master or UEFI? I hear you should do one or the other, but not make changes using both? I'm used changing with UEFI but the last time I made any changes, it was 6 years ago with my 3570K and things have changed. Right now I'm doing everything in the UEFI but if Ryzen master is better, I can switch over.

2) Enable DOCP? This will allow my ram to perform at it's actual speeds instead of the default 2133. Should I also raise my RAM voltages a bit? Default is 1.35v but should I bump it to say 1.37v?

3) XFR and Precision Boost 2.0. If I were to make zero changes, these would be enabled by default as they're innate to the CPU and won't change unless I start manually tweaking settings? Does this mean if I were to run something like Prime95, I should see increased clock speeds and voltages going to my CPU under load because PB2 and XFR are doing their jobs?

4) If I were to take things a step further, I could go into my UEFI and change the Precision Boost Overdrive setting from auto to enabled? this would give me a bit of extra performance but wouldn't effect XFR or PB?

Is there anything else I need to be aware of?  I really just want to make sure I'm getting what I paid for. Thanks for the help!"

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;

The streams were loaded by the tower with care,

In hopes that Lisa soon would be there;

The gamers were nestled all snug in their beds;

While visions of 10 cores danced in their heads;

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like a flash,

Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,

Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,

When what to my wondering eyes did appear,

But a navi gpu and  new cpus,

With a little old driver so lively and quick,

She must be Lisa i knew in a tick,

More rapid than eagles her coursers they came,

And she whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

""Now, Piledriver! now, Bulldozer! now Polaris and Vega!

On, Eypc! on, Ryzen! on, Vishera and Ryzen+!

To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!

Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""

As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,

When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;

So up to the CES the coursers they flew

With the sleigh full of toys, and Lisa too—

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof

The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

Down the chimney Lisa came with a bound.

And she looked like she was ready,

 to give intel and nvidia a good fight!

I've tried to manually set wattmam's minimum RPM to the max (6k) just to try and do ANYTHING to solve it.

I don't really care about noise since I always use headphones anyways. I've also ramped up the power limit % to max as well (50). Even after doing this it never seems to ramp up fully and at times it will randomly stay at below 100RPM and the GPU will overheat.

I've tried using the DD Uninstaller and reinstalling the adrenaline drivers fresh again. Still having the issue. I tried fooling around with SpeedFan but couldn't get the hang of it and didn't want to completely screw anything up.

Short of a full OS reinstall I'm stumped. I know its not an issue with the GPU itself or else it wouldn't be spinning at all, so I'm fairly certain its a software issue.

Amd,AlexanderDLarge,7,1,"Will the Acer XR341CK's FreeSync flicker or ""ghost"" as seen in that video put out today?Unfortunately due to my resolution, I couldn't settle for Vega 64 performance so I had to go with the 1080Ti. I've since bought an Acer 34 inch ultrawide IPS monitor with an alleged FreeSync range of 30-75hz (saw this on a forum post, can't verify) intending to buy into Navi/Vega 2 in the future.

It seems discussion of the issue is pretty obscure so I figured asking AMD users with the monitor would be the best way to find out.

How can I fix it? My XFX rx 580 gts ran well with the fan speed at 2600 rpm but now with the stock settings it stays near 3000 RPM and it is noticeably way louder. If it requires a bit of undervolting stuff I am willing to do that because the games I play do not really require full draw from the GPU(I play esports like overwatch, CS, Quake, and occasionally some destiny 2 @ 1080p so I don't need full mode).

Amd,Telicopter,23,1,"Is there any underclock/undervolt tool for ryzen mobile? And, if not, will one ever be released?I have a Ryzen mobile laptop that I love (Huawei Matebook D 14), but my only problem has been that I feel the fans kick in way too early (40 degrees Celsius). I have not had a problem with heat since the laptop handles it very well I think (never gotten above 70 degrees Celsius and usually hover around or below 40).

But, I just really don't like the fans being on a lot of the time like if I am just watching a video. And, I think because it has a more powerful 4 core CPU, more heat is being generated than other laptops I've used. After trying several options, I thought maybe undervolting would be a good decision. The laptop is plenty powerful for whatever I need, and I can maintain clock speed (although not even necessary) while lowering temperature and increasing battery life.

But, there just seems to be no undervolting tool for Ryzen mobile. I know people have had trouble with support of these laptops and driver stuff, but will AMD ever release some tool to undervolt?

1. Mouse Lag on Startup and when playing games (makes PC completely unusable)
2. Card Stutters terribly from time to time required a full reboot
3. Card can't hold a stable over clock it seems. (I still need to fiddle with this more) 

The only remedy I found is to use the 120hz setting on my 144hz monitor. And my PC begins to have mouse lag, simply toggling my monitor to 144hz and back to 120hz fixes it. But keep in mind I have to do that every startup. 

I have done more of ""remedies"" the interweb recommends. Disabling HDCP, Moving the power limit to +50, Rolling back driver to 18.12.1, etc. I am assuming all of this is a driver issue?

The part that I find a bit worrying is that for the integrated AMD graphics like the 2400G I read a lot about driver issues. I had originally assumed that this is the same driver and there should be no difference to the dedicated GPUs, but it seems I was wrong about that.

Is there a significant difference in driver support and stability between using a 2400G integrated GPU or a dedicated RX550, RX560 or a Radeon Pro WX 2100?

&amp;#x200B;

I finished building my Ryzen 7 2700x system just over a week ago and have been monitoring the temps.

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to know if the temps I'm getting are normal. I've read through many posts on this but there seems to be a wide range of opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

I have seated the heatsink correctly using the pre-applied paste that came with the cooler. I am using the MSI b450 tomahawk MB and the only setting I have changed is switching on the XFR2 profile which sets my RAM to 3200mhz. I have left the switch on the cooler set to 'low' for noise reduction. I am also using the Windows Balanced power plan.

&amp;#x200B;

Ryzen master is reporting idle temps of 27c and full load temps between 70c - 80c while gaming (except for Vermintide 2 which spikes to 86c for a second then cools back down into the 70's)

&amp;#x200B;

Prime95 Blender on 16 threads slowly creeps up to 82c over 30 mins then seems to drop back down to 78c then slowly back to 82c

&amp;#x200B;

Single core runs 4.1ghz - 4.3ghz, all cores run between 3.8ghz and 4.05ghz constantly under load.

&amp;#x200B;

I understand these aren't the best temps and my fan switch is still on 'low' But are they anything to worry about? Should I just leave it as is, or are there some simple tweaks I can do without manually overclocking?

So it turns out that there are two versions of the M715Q, the first gen that has an 8MiB BIOS chip, and a 2nd gen with a 16MiB BIOS chip. Only the 2nd gen models have the RavenPI AGESA BIOS, likely due to the new bios requiring a 16MiB chip. I was able to successfully flash the 2nd gen BIOS onto a new 16MiB chip, then swap the chips on the motherboard with some solder work. The BIOS chip is underneath the CPU fan on the system board. I haven't dropped in a 2400GE yet, but now that the RavenPI AGESA is showing up in CPU-Z, I'm pretty confident it will be a drop-in replacement :)

The 1050ti has served me well, except I'm convinced that the 4GB VRAM is not future proof and also some of the games I want to play at ultra aren't running at the frame rates I'd like (I'm playing on 1080p for the forseeable future). There's also rumours of the new AMD cards that will raise the performance baseline except that I know that the price in my country will be about 1.5-1.75 times the MSRP so I might not be able to buy them on release ( for an idea the RX 580 and the 1060 are widely being sold for a higher price than the 590 at some of the most reputable stores over here).  


The games promotion is also very compelling. Taking those factors into account I'm kind of wondering if I should upgrade to the 590 or just stick it out with the 1050ti. What would you guys suggest?

Amd,xHopefull123,1,1,"PBO causes Core &amp; Voltage spikes while idleingHello,

so I got the Ryzen 2700x and while idleing, I notice Core and Voltage spikes. Lets say 3-4 cores tend to spike towards 4.35Ghz with Voltage going up towards 1.43 at its max. 

I am using a 240 water cooler which I will probably return and get a fitting air cooler like the Dark Rock 4 instead since I do not plan on overclocking manually (probably only going to game and stream, maybe do some light editing). Also, the pump is too loud imo while idleing, I do not care about the noise while gaming since I am not hearing anything due to the fact that I am using a headset. I am not gonna say the name of the AIO, but I guess it is more of a cheap one compared to Brands like Corsair, Bequiet or NZXT.

However those Voltage spikes result in temperature spikes, usually from 33°C towards 43°C, sometimes less or more. And this results in my pump making weird noises since it basically adjusts its RPM and I get those up and down noises which I hope I will not get using an Air cooler - I am fairly sure the pump right now is louder than the Dark Rock 4 would get under load, also I prefer ""Fan noises"" instead of ""pump noises"".

Those problems however would solve if I could adjust the PBO (which I am assuming is the reason for those spikes) so it only activates while gaming, adjusting power settings doesn't really help since I have games where my CPU is only being used like 50% or even less, so it would just sit on 2.3Ghz in those games if I am using the power saving option. AMD Ryzen Master isn't an option for me as I cannot get it running, always freezes while starting saying ""... AMD Ryzen Master stopped working""

**CASE:**

Unlike most people, I decided upon the Silverstone SG11 over the SG13 due to a few things. Firstly, I thought that mesh front cover was incredibly ugly, but mostly, I wanted as few compromises as possible and this case was the best that would offer that. Just for a rundown, it offers 9 2.5"" drive bays, support for full sized GPUs, support for full sized PSUs, support for full sized M-ATX boards, a 5.25"" drive bay and a (iirc) 82mm CPU cooler limitation. All in a 22l package that can fit snug anywhere. 

However, I have some qualms with the case for those who want to get it. Firstly, it does lack 120mm fan space, only having one slot which is prefilled and is honestly a pain in the ass to get to without a long ass screwdriver. You have to unscrew the main drive bay from the bottom of the case and force it out, then replace the garbage included fan with something more suitable. It's a pain, and otherwise the case only offers two 80mm fans on the top. I would've liked a second 120mm on the other side, but I understand that would interfere with three slot GPUs.

Additionally, it doesn't have a great capability for cable management and it's an incredibly snug fit for larger M-ATX boards like mine. It can feel a little \_too\_ tight, but it does work fine and I wouldn't worry about it.

Lastly, it isn't available in white, which is criminal.

**FANS:**

Possibly the most important part to making a computer silent, I spent an absolute eternity optimizing the fan curves here so that I have dead silence during idle and light use. To do this, I set my fan curves incredibly low. I found that the 80mm Noctua fan (set to exhaust) is very loud at high speeds, so I've limited that to 400RPM until the CPU reaches 75-Celsius, wherein it goes to 550RPM. It ramps to full speed (with a Noctua Low-Speed Adapter) at 85-Celsius. My 120mm case fan (intake) is less loud, so it is allowed to run at 500RPM while the CPU is below 75-Celsius and similarly ramps up to full speed at 85-celsius. Lastly, the CPU cooler is by far the quietest at high speeds, so I'm able to run it at 1000RPM while the CPU is below 75-Celsius, but sound output increases dramatically once it gets higher than this. Again, it goes to full speed at 85-Celsius.

This generally allows for an idle temp of 50-Celsius with the tweaks I've made to the CPU which I'll underline shortly. It's dead silent under this operation (to the point where my GPU coil whine is by far the loudest part of the system) and I can only hear a slight whisper when my ear is firmly planted to the side of the case. 

I absolutely want to replace the 80mm fan for Noctua's higher end version, and also get two of them. This should help with the admittedly very toasty full load temps which I'll underline shortly.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img i9hkl7475g321...*

**CPU:**

This is the part which required the most tweaking by far. I had a lot of trouble reaching the undervolts and overclocks that I wanted to (though much of this was due to my RAM not being stable at its rated speeds) through bios, which does not offer P-state overclocking. I needed something which would clock down at idle so I would be able to reach my silence goals, so I had to think a little outside the box. My solution was A-tuning.

And oh my lord is Asrock's A-tuning software a godsend. I'm able to set hotkeys to different CPU states that I set, with different voltages and clockspeeds being available to me at the tap of a macro key. After a lot of tinkering for the perfect speeds and voltages, I've finally settled for this:

3Ghz at 1.15v mapped to CTRL-E for everyday use - Idle temps (50C), Game temps (75C), Full Load temps (80C)

3.5Ghz at 1.225v mapped to CTRL-W for slightly more demanding games - Game temps (80C), Full Load temps (83C)

4Ghz at 1.31v mapped to CTRL-Q for demanding games - Game temps (85C), Full Load temps (92C)

I love this solution for the fact that it's always available to me and it allows me to find the perfect setting to get a constant 1080p/60fps in every game. However, I am conscious that full load temps are still relatively high (though not dangerously so) and I want to add another fan to make sure this doesn't happen. 

With this set-up, I'm able to play the majority of games with dead-silence, since most don't require anything more than 3ghz. Of course, this isn't the case when I'm playing recent AAA titles, but I'm generally okay with noise during gameplay.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img i95md4695g321...*

**GPU:**

The only real tweak I *needed* to make to this was the cut-off point where it would start the fan, which was originally 60C. Generally, this would be reached when in a discord video call while sharing video on rabbit, something I do constantly with my BF. The noise of it turning on and shutting off every few seconds was the most obnoxious thing in the world, even with my headset (which I rarely use outside of calls because speakers rule) on. Hence, I just set that cut off point to 70C in MSI Afterburner and now it reaches a high of 67C (though does do the turn off, turn on thing in most games as it hovers between 69C and 70C, which doesn't annoy me as much) during non-gaming workloads, though mostly stays in the 50s. 

Because I loved the hotkey idea so much though, I did set my GPU to some profiles as well:

\+0 Core, +0 Mem, +0v, 100% Power Limit bound to CTRL-I

\+100 Core, +300 mem, +0v, 100% Power Limit bound to CTRL-O

\+140 Core, +400 mem, +87mv, 110% Power Limit (93C temp limit) bound to CTRL-P

I don't experience temperatures above 82C in any state here with my fancurves in any game. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ymk9lvxr5g321...*

**RAM:**

Ugh. This is my only disappointment, as I just can't seem to get 3000mhz at all. Even 2933mhz is slightly unstable. No matter what I do, I'm stuck on 2866mhz. Soon, I'll probably try to tighten my timings a little at this speed, but honestly, the amount of BSOD headaches this ram set has caused hasn't been worth it. 2866mhz is fine, it works. Bleh.

**Conclusion:**

I am so happy with how this system came out. I had to relegate all my HDDs to external enclosures because they're by far the loudest components for most well tuned builds, so putting them in a cupboard where noise cannot be heard was the only reasonable option, but I'll soon be investing in two 1tb M.2 SSDs to replace mechanical drives entirely. Additionally, I do wish I had better luck with my ram, but overall, I am so proud of my little shoebox. Compared to my old Bitfenix Phenom M, you're far better with airflow, far smaller and far prettier.

* [TIMESTAMP - 13:14](https://youtu.be/6MPDsy4eDC8?t=13m14s) - Why is a Polaris successor a top priority for the first 7nm consumer GPUs? 

 * AMD's staggered GPU release schedule means Polaris 10 &amp; 11 are up next for replacement. While Nvidia has the R&amp;D funding to release an entire lineup at once, AMD must replace individual GPUS piecemeal on a staggered basis, often every 3 years based on history:

 * 7nm will initially be very expensive. While AMD's first 7nm GPU, Vega 20, can afford being 331mm2 because it's pro-only, a consumer-centric GPU must be smaller. Just like AMD started with mid-range on 14nm with Polaris, they will start with mid-range on 7nm with Navi. The chips are smaller and simpler since they only need 4 shader engines (which is still a fundamental limitation of GCN as of Vega). 

* [TIMESTAMP - 16:52](https://youtu.be/6MPDsy4eDC8?t=16m52s) - Why is AMD waiting so long to compete at the high end? 

 * There's a 4 shader engine (i.e. 64CU) limitation in GCN that has not yet been overcome. This takes time &amp; engineering effort. [Adtech has confirmed that this limitation is still in place as of Vega 10 and it hasn't been removed due to the effort required](https://www.adtech.com/show/11717/the-amd-radeon-rx-vega-64-and-56-review/2). 

 * Once the 4SE limitation is fixed, the tech still isn't ready. AMD has two options for a &gt;64CU GPU and neither is feasible in 2019. 

 Large GPU Strategy | Description | Issues Causing a 2020+ Timeline
--- | --- | ---
Chiplet-Style | This would use multiple small yield-friendly chips connected together to act as one large GPU, [similar to Rome on CPUs](https://www.adtech.com/show/13560/amd-unveils-chiplet-design-approach-7nm-zen-2-cores-meets-14-nm-io-die). | This requires a very fast/efficient interconnect to let the chips talk to each other. While Infinity Fabric 2 has brought a massive 2.4x increase in bandwidth, it's still not enough for a latency-sensitive consumer GPU. We'll see chiplet designs in CPUs and professional GPUs, but consumer gaming GPUs need lightning fast latencies to keep gaming frame time hitches down. 
Monolithic | This would be the classic single-chip way to build a GPU. | It would need to be 300+mm2 and that is too big for an initial 7nm GPU. Once EUV is fixed, 7nm yields might improve enough to allow for this. 

Going forward, Baseless Speculation will be recorded as needed and the participants may shift. We welcome feedback and look forward to future discussions! "

* [Sapphire Nitro+ RX Vega 64](http://www.sapphiretech.com/productdetial.asp?Pid=6A72A3C3-DF09-4552-9091-792B1F45CB4D&amp;lang=eng)
* [BIOS](https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/200283/sapphire-rxvega64-8192-180125) 240W
* Ryzen 5 2600x@stock
* Software: AMD Wattman, AIDA64, HWinfo, Unigine Heaven, Unigine Superposition, 3DMark Firestrike, The Division

**Method**

First i set out to find the highest stable clocks for core voltages from 900 to 1200mV. I ran Unigine Heaven 1080p in the background and set the core voltages and a very conservative target clock for p7. I raised core clocks fairly quickly in 5Mhz increments until a crash occured and then stepped down 10Mhz.

This resulted in stable overclocks for all voltages up to 1050mV. At 1100 and 1150mV I had to step down an additional 5Mhz to get stable benchmarks and 1200mV would not be stable at frequencies higher than those at 1150mV (although AIDA64 stress test was running fine at 1740Mhz effective). Instead I added tests for the stock settings with Power Level +50%.

Next I used AIDA64 to put synthetic load on the card and let it reach peak thermals. Then I used HWinfo to measure average effective clocks and Chip power consumption.

Afterwards I first ran 3DMark Firestrike on all settings since I found this to be the most likely test to crash the system then Unigine Superposition and lastly The Division benchmark.

All three benchmarks were onlx run once (sorry) and the results averaged and expressed as percentage of stock settings.

All test were done with HBM2 at 1050Mhz and voltage floor at 900mV.

Thermals were never a problem with the highest core temps at 76° C throughout all test.

**Observations**

1. Raising the core voltage above 1150mV and frequency target over 1800 did not lead to stable settings. I guess there's the limit of my silicon.
2. **Under 1000mV the HBM2 will throttle down to 800Mhz, under 950 it will throttle to 500Mhz!**

**Results**

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/k54p6rqi2i321.png

This graph shows the target clocks for p7 and the stable frequencies achieved under AIDA64 synthetic load for each undervolt. Note the bad performance for stock settings.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/vg3j6yv33i321.png

Power consumption in AIDA64 shows that at stock PWL+50% the card is not using the available power. This is due to the fact that the 1630Mhz frequency target for p7 only results in 1570Mhz effective clocks thus not nearly using the available power.

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0khkg8uy3i321.png

Here's the important numbers. At 1100mV my card will consume as much power as stock PWL+50% with 10% more performance and at 950mV will perform as good as stock with a hefty 38% less power uptake.

But at 950mV the HBM2 will throttle to 800Mhz and thats just leaving performance on the table. So the sweetspot appears to be 1000mV with 7% improved performance and more than 25% reduced power.

Could AMD have done better? I suspect the very conservative settings were put in place to achieve higher silicon yields. This is underlined by the fact that there are Vegas out there that don't undervolt well or at all. Those are sadly the loosers of the silicon lottery.

Maybe AMD could have binned the chips and released a ""locked"" version of Vega that has conservative settings and an ""unlocked"" version that comes factory undervolted/overclocked and lets you play around with Wattman even more? That sounds alot like intel marketing strategy...

Or is my chip a ""golden chip""? Can other people weigh in with what their cards achieve when undervolted?

**Tl;dr**

On my specific card, I can either get 10% extra performance at roughly the same power consumption or the same performance at a third less power uptake. Sweetspot is at 1000mV."

Amd,thalles-adorno,0,1,"What should I buy ?So, I live in Brazil and I'll be traveling abroad and to a developed country. I'd like your suggestions about what should I buy (I'm playing mainly eSports with that occasionally triple A game, don't use my computer as a workstation but when I'm doing University things I can easily eat 10Gb of Ram as I use a lot of programs). I can bring up to 500 dollars back without taxes, but doesn't mean I'll have that kind of money. Here is my build and my initial thoughts about what I should buy:


* Intel Core i5 5675C (the second worst offender)
* 16Gb of Ram (I really use them, but I can survive with 12Gb)
* Vega 56 flashed to 64
* 1Tb HD (the worst offender)
* 1080p monitor overclocked to 74Hz, no freesync (and I can't see the difference between 60Hz and 74Hz, for the record, I see things a little different).

My ideas:

1. ""Upgrade kit, Ryzen 1600 or above, at least 12Gb of Ram and a Mobo""
* Pros: way better CPU performance, I sometimes choke my i5 to death. I can give my current build to my brother who uses an old A7600 AMD APU. Mg i5 will provide way more CPU performance and a little more iGPU performance. I also can give my brother's system to a friend who plays on second gen i3.
* Cons: HDs are way too slow, as someone who have a surface book, the difference is very big.


2. 480Gb SSD 
* Pros: way better storage performance and half a terabyte more storage space.
* Cons: I will still choke my i5 to death. Can't help anyone.


3. A new 144Hz and freesync monitor
* Pros: some people say it is worlds better.
* Cons: I've never had the opportunity to see one in action though, I don't see a 25% fps difference in my monitor, can't help anyone.


4. New headphone: 
* Pros: I have a Razer headphone which is turning to dust, but still sounds good to me (same thing with fps, I can't hear the difference)
* Cons: None, if I can only afford this one.

5. Something not even related to PC: I don't know how much money I will have and I might change my mind about the upgrade, so who knows.


I'd like to ask you to give your opinions, please, and help me create a priority list. I know, each person is different but I feel like this will help. Tyvm for your time.

I don’t know exactly how the current Vega cores sit on the Raven Ridge die, however I’m sure it would still be cheaper to fab than a full 330^2mm die like on the Instincts. Hopefully taking some of the cost away from the expensive nature of the new node.

# Issue

Currently, no one in their right mind would recommend a Ryzen Mobile laptop to anyone unless it has a dGPU. Instead going out and buying a slightly more expensive device with an intel/MX130 (or MX150) combo seems like the smarter thing to do because in the end you're getting a similarly built system for less with slightly higher power consumption, better stability and even better performance.

Ryzen APUs were supposed to show what's possible with only one chip and system RAM, not requiring us consumers to spend ridiculous amounts of money on GDDR5 GPUs with honestly overpriced intel CPUs at this point because those Ryzen laptops can keep up well with last-gen nVidia dGPUs and current-gen low-end nVidia GPUs. They outperform intel HD/UHD graphics by miles and often come in better built, sleeker packages and because we're talking about an APU, the power consumption is a lot lower (ranging from 12 - 25W) thus requiring less fans and cooling components to keep the system from overheating and even throttling if done right.

Especially students who need a slim laptop and don't plan on playing the newest triple A titles on their system thought this was their big break. The HP Envy x360 is the perfect student laptop for both school work and light gaming, easily being able to play older triple A titles at FHD with stable 30-40 FPS.

When it comes to myself I needed something from HP that supported their UltraSlim dockingstation and without spending too much, could show some decent performance in the games I play. The HP EliteBook 755 G5 seemed like the perfect device with the Ryzen 7 CPU being able to outperform the i7 8th gen chips and the Vega 10 GPU technically being able to keep up with the 940MX in games that were well optimized, which is the case for the games I play.

I laid out in my previous two [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/9uy1zy/amd_needs_to_take_over_driver_distribution_for/) what the issue with Ryzen Mobile currently is, but for those who don't want to read those, here's a short summary:

AMD made it clear at the launch of Ryzen Mobile that their OEMs would distribute the drivers, when purchasing my laptop, I knew that and didn't make much of it. I was aware that OEMs are sluggish at driver updates, but I was expecting at the very least some stable drivers. And googling for issues with Ryzen Mobile didn't yield me many results. After buying my system and using it for 6 weeks and counting, I started encountering a lot of [issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/9ug1f5/hpamd_driver_support_for_ryzen_mobile_is_terrible/), some of which I've seen many others have and other issues seems to be completely unique to my system, which is why I've already talked to HP about repairing my system, but after testing different drivers, I was sure that even if my system was malfunctioning, the biggest issues still had to do with the drivers and repairing it would just fix the issues unique to my system.

The currently newest drivers for my system on HP's website is the Radeon Settings 17.7 and AMD doesn't offer any drivers on their website. Other OEMs have similar versions of the Radeon Settings on their website and the newest GPU drivers on the Windows Update Catalog for the Vega 8 and Vega 10 are from August of this year, meaning that they're already 3 months old and they don't come with the Radeon Settings which are over a year old on Ryzen Mobile system. All the official GPU drivers are full of issues and the most stable one for me was the 18.9.3 release from AMD's website which doesn't officially support Ryzen Mobile, but hey, it works. Proof that AMD does have the ""code"" to support Ryzen Mobile - if they wanted to.

# Question

I'm sure no one at AMD is happy that their latest mobile platform is rigged with issues and thus can't show what it's truly capable of, I'm sure no one at AMD wanted this to happen when they gave OEMs the responsibility of distributing drivers and I'm sure that if it were possible, you guys would be working on something to help out those who've trusted AMD by buying a brand-new platform instead of spending their well-earned cash on an established platform with intel and nVidia components.

The question now stands if you guys really have something stopping you from distributing drivers on your website? The issue has gotten so ridiculous that some tinfoil-hat wearers are betting that some clause between you and the OEMs exist that's stopping you from releasing official drivers on your website for Vega 6, Vega 8 and Vega 10. It's clear that you guys are working on something because all the packs starting version 18.10.1 have ""support"" for the RadeonT RX Vega 10 which I'm guessing is the mobile Vega 10 GPU. The problem with those is just that they have to be force-installed and at least in my experience, they're unstable as hell and the 18.11.1 update doesn't even install on my system :/.

I know that there are AMD employees active on this subreddit, I just found a few, including /u/AMD_Kyle, /u/AMDJoe, /u/parkbot, /u/amd_andy and /u/FairlyOddParents. The question to you guys (and the other AMD employees) is if you guys are aware of this issue and if you guys are working on something to start supporting Ryzen Mobile through driver updates on your website like you should've in the beginning."

&gt; The worst memory related issue on this platform is that there is no way to tune the memory controller parameters.  
 They are hard coded into the memory controller firmware (PMU) and cannot  be changed by anyone but AMD. This prevents the manufacturers from  optimizing the parameters specifically for their designs.

Amd,aht3Eip1re1k,6,1,"True 'auto' voltage of RX580?Hi,

I have started to undervolt my RX580 Nitro+ 8G (the one with 1411 MHz clock). I am trying to figure out the sweet spot with voltage and I am really, really confused now, googling around adds more questions than I got answers so far, so let me ask few things here

- What is the 'auto' voltage? As I see in HWMonitor, when card is left on 'auto' and I run some automated testing, the max voltage is 1.2V. However when I set it to 'manual' in AMD Wattman, it shows that State7 voltage is 1.150. I've read that the auto is actually different for every card and is set by 'the hardware' so I suppose those manual voltages are not the 'default of my card' one.

- Is there a way that I could force for example State5, then put card under load and probe what voltage it does give me on 'auto'?

Right now I am running on state 3-7 (max) on 1.075V and it 'seems' stable. according to HWMonitor, power draw of card went from 175W (power limit set in bios) to 153W during syntetic load testing, and during playing Far Cry 5 the max reached is now 125W (was 174W)"
Amd,ashesnroses,76,1,"Building the most future-proof all-gaming PC for ""4K""/60 Freesync gameplay under 1100$The build is made to exceed PS5's specs which I try to narrow down in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/9rtnao/speculation_playstation_5_specifications/) post I made two weeks ago.

* 8C/16T for rare sub 60 dips.
* 16GB fast RAM for no hitching.
* RX Vega 64 at 12.66 TFLOPs should be enough to cover the 10 TFLOPs GPU inside PS5, the extra improvements by Navi architecture as well as benefiting from the DX12 shift in game development.
* 500GB SSD to improve loading times.

Enough performance to last throughout the entire PS5 lifecycle including midway refreshes. (+8 years from today)

* CPU Overclock: 3.6/3.7Ghz @ 1.2/1.25/1.3v
* **GPU Underclock**

It's a 1800p/60 High Freesync gaming PC, obviously can't run native 4K/60. On a 27"" 4K monitor the difference is minimal and not worth it IMO.

Amd,HowDoIMathThough,24,1,"With all the talk about mobile Raven Ridge driver issues - has anyone with an Asus X505ZA tried the recent (11th Oct '18) drivers?There's a lot of finger-pointing going on and I figure the best way to cut through it is to be sensible and apply logic.  If AMD can't push drivers, and it really is entirely on the OEMs, maybe some OEMs *do* have more recent drivers that fix the issues people have been having.

After a bit of looking I found [this ASUS Raven Ridge laptop](https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ASUS-VivoBook-15-X505ZA/HelpDesk_Download/) which has ""chipset"" drivers dated 2018-10-11 that look much too big to be just chipset drivers.  Downloading and extracting them to take a look at the files, **they do include GPU drivers** - it seems Asus just label the packages as ""chipset"" on their AMD APU systems.  The last modification timestamp for the GPU drivers is 2018-06-21 on the folders and appears to be 2018-05-23 on all the files, which is still more recent than what's available for other systems and is consistent with the suggestion that OEMs also take time to verify driver stability (though god knows what against given the issues people have had).

If anyone has one of these Asus laptops it would be greatly appreciated if you could try them out and check;

* If they are indeed a more recent GPU driver version

* If the more recent version resolves any issues

If they really do sort things out it would vindicate AMD's position, make it possible to recommend (certain) AMD laptops again, and allow those who are set on an AMD laptop to vote with their wallet against shitty driver support.

For people with other Raven laptops I'd also be interested to hear results but would note that even if they do install, they might have weird issues if the stuff about per-oem customisations is to be believed."

Amd,Brah_ddah,8,1,"AIO mistake possibly damaged my 1600x?Hello, I just built a new PC so I made some changes to my prior ryzen 1600x PC. I have the Corsair h55 on a b350m mortar board. I have slotted in my old rx 480 sapphire nitro plus as well. 

Here's what happened: I ran cinebench on my new PC and noticed that the fans spin up while benchmarking. I thought to myself, ""that makes sense"", but realized I had never really heard the fans spin up very much in my old PC. So, realizing that AIO's come with at least one fan and a pump, I looked at the headers on my mortar motherboard and saw that I had the pump plugged into CPU_Fan and the radiator fan plugged into SYS_Fan. I wondered if the reason for the lack of fan spin up under load was because of that, so I switched them. I read online that the pump doesn't need anything other than constant voltage, so I thought I was safe.

I ran cinebench again and the fans got faster! I also heard a liquid sound for the first time in the AIO (like I had heard on my new floe 360). Success!! I thought. I assumed I was just dumb in my installation of the cooler back in my noob  days. I then realized this could be the reason my chip was unstable at 3.9ghz so I overclocked it and ran it again, and got a much higher score. At this point I'm getting pumped. This is going to be the best guest computer ever.

Until the computer started crashing on every game. HOTS, fortnite, whatever. Each time the EZ debug CPU light lit up. The ryzen master OC removed itself. I thought it could erroneously be the old GPU, so I tried another rx 570 I have for mining. Same issue. The computer appeared to be getting pretty hot from the exhaust fan, so I wondered if I had damaged the AIO from the switch since heat appeared to be higher from the exhaust fan. I installed the wraith LED cooler and tested again. It ran longer but eventually crashed. 

I feel like this is a huge loss.

Any idea about how to confirm the issue? 

Also, if anybody can shed some light on how I need to hook up my Thermaltake floe 360 on my new PC so I avoid this issue in the future... that would be awesome. I have the pump installed on CPU_Fan and the fans connected to the premium TT fan controller, which has one PWM connector per 3 fans.

Amd,McFlyParadox,14,1,"2700X Idles at 82-85C with an AIOSo I just upgraded to a 2700X (the mobo on my 3770K died), and I seem to be getting \*very\* high idle temperatures with stock clocking and voltages.

I was going to stress test it this morning, just to make sure it is stable under full load, and decided to doublecheck temps before I got started. I was surprised to see such high temps, because I had already run 3DMark a few times and have been gaming with it all yesterday, with no issues.

I am cooling it with an H115i Pro with the 280mm radiator (30C), and I have already tried re-applying thermal paste (Arctic Silver 5). It looked alright when I pulled it off, maybe a \*touch\* too much, but nothing that alarmed me - no over-spill, nice even coat on the processor, just looked like a little too much on cooler side when it came off. Nothing that should have caused 80C idle temps though. I briefly fired up Prime95, just to see what would happen, and it immediately spiked to 120C (it shut it down less than a second in). Right now, the voltages are sitting stable at 1.29V, and there is no overclock.

Amd,ThanksBroseph,68,1,"Don't get the logic of people recommending 2700x over i9 for higher res gaming...help?Fact: 8700k and i9 CPUs have significantly more FPS @ 720p and 1080p in every single game.

Fact: @ 4k the 2700x and 8700k/i9 CPUs there is negligible difference or none at all because all games are GPU bound.

Conclusion: My brain short circuits. Why?

Because I think about the future. If the 2700x is getting slaughtered @ 720p and 1080p, and only shines at higher resolutions, this means that once better GPUs come out and games are not longer bound the 2700x will go back to providing lower FPS at even higher resolutions.

For example, let's think ahead to 8k. Surely due within a few years or more. By that time there will be GPUs that blow the 2080ti out of the water; the 4080ti @ 8k will not be GPU bound as the pendulum swings back to CPU/memory bottlenecking.

Using the above imagined scenario the 2700x will be back at the ""struggling with 720/1080p"" resolutions, would it not? 


The low res benchmarks demonstrate games leaving the GPU alone and stressing the CPU almost exclusively - the 2700x is 15-20% worse in these scenarios. 

All it would take is a new GPU to come out that is much more powerful and not bottlenecked by the newest sexiest game, and the i9s would be able to handle the GPU whilst the 2700x wouldn't. 

In conclusion, isn't the Intel line more future proof at this point in time (without mentioning Zen2) than the 2700x as hinted by the low res benchmarks?

This isn't a rant, if what I stated above makes any sense than the i9 will be able to keep up for at least 3 years with top GPUs while the 2700x is not future proof for even a year due to Zen2 and the foreshadowing already that games like Assassin's Creed Odyssey for some reason take 15-20% kinder to Intels new releases at low res.

Which honestly pisses me off because I was hoping to not break the bank and get a comfy 2700x setup without having to get a more expensive i9, a more expensive motherboard, and an aftermarket cooler to boot :("

*""So I have an update on the AMD Navi GPU front. I have been informed that  AMD has finalized the first Navi design and codenamed it Navi 12. We  also know that the GPU will have 40 CUs. If the ratio of stream processors in the CU is the same as that of GCN, then you are looking at 64 CUs each for a grand total of 2560 stream processors. This is going  to be posited as the upgrade path from Polaris 30 and will probably  feature in the Radeon 600 series.*

*AMD Roadmap TLDR as I have heard:*

* *Vega 7nm will not be coming to gamers.*
* *Navi 12 will be the first Navi part to arrive and will be landing  sometime in 1H 2019.  Navi 10 has either been scrapped or will follow  later sometime in late 2019 or early 2020, depending on a couple of  factors. The performance level of this part will be equivalent to Vega  and it will be a small GPU based on 7nm.*
* *Navi 20 is going to be the true high-end GPU built on the 7nm node  and as things stand right now, you are tentatively looking at it landing  sometime around late 2020 – 2021.*
* *Navi will also be the first architecture to transition away from GCN  (and along with it, the 4096 SP / 64 CU limit that is inherent to the  uArch implementation).*
* *‘Next-Gen’ architecture is the uArch formerly codenamed KUMA  internally before AMD decided it didn’t like that name too much (oops)  and will be based on the same brand new major architecture that AMD  rolls out with Navi.""*

Let's just go with some nice round numbers for the sake of simplicity like it being 8 cores, 16 threads, 4.5Ghz base clock and a boost to 5Ghz on a single core. 150W TDP. Price would be 400$ MSRP.

&amp;#x200B;

Now that we have that, here is my question. What are the chances for AMD to release a budget Threadripper alternative to the 3700X intended for multi-core/thread workload, something like a 3720X?  


Supposed specs: 16 cores and 32 threads, a base clock of 3,0Ghz and a boost clock to 3.5Ghz with a similar 150W TDP for 400$ MSRP.

Ever since I bought the card and my 6 monitors, I've been using 6x active mini display port to DVI adaptors (all of which die without warning from time to time and have all been replaced several times over) to drive my 6 Dell E207WFP's - the Dell screens are slowly failing from old age and I've already swapped out a couple via ebay and I need to start thinking about replacing them all, so the question is....

Can I avoid using active adaptors entirely by buying new displays that already have a DP socket? IE 6 mini display port cables straight out the back of the card and into the back of each monitor? Or is there a technical requirement for active adaptors when running this many displays with a Gfx card this old?

Honestly, the 6870 is a dear friend to me and I would be sad to see it go.

Amd,TheShivara,0,1,"Slightly undervolting Sapphire Vega 64 Nitro+ without any experienceHey guys! So I just finished my build with a Sapphire Vega 64 Nitro+ and it seems to be an amazingly capable card. But it has some horrible coil whine and I keep reading that undervolting it slightly could be a good option to reduce that.

Actually everything seems to work better with an undervolted card: lower temps, lower noise, less coil whine and lower power consumption, and all that for a tiny drop in FPS. The problem is that I have never done this before and have no idea where to start.

Could you direct me to some ""safe and easy"" undervolt values for Wattman or something like that? All I can find is tons of ""this is how far I could push it before it got unstable"". That is not what I am looking for. Maybe half the way to that point. Or only 30% of the maximum you could do. I don't want to push any limits, I don't want to take any risks, just a nice and easy undervolt to get the most out of my card.

Thanks in advance!"
Amd,guismo,120,1,"Possibly unpopular opinion: Banning personal build posts or having a ""AMD news"" subreddit?I hope I don't get downvoted to hell and there are others with this opinion or that we can just discuss why we shouldn't change things:

I do enjoy seeing what/how people build their pcs but this subreddit seems to be made mostly of it, and it gets very tiring and hard to avoid those links. I subscribed to this subreddit because I like AMD and I want to know how they are doing, what are they releasing, what people found out about it, what is happening and discussions in general. I enjoyed seeing people's build the first few hundred times but then now it's just making me want to unsubscribe, if there was an active and healthy subreddit with what I mentioned...

There are already subreddits devoted to building and showing a pc and to me most of the posts are just.... things people bought and put together. It may be an exageration but I compare it to buying noodles and making it. You went there, bought it and made it. A super expensive noodle that takes 1 hour to make, but stil... I'm not going to learn much from that specially after seeing it hundreds of times, unless there is something special and unique about it. And the majority of these posts are not special. Just colorful.

I really don't want to offend these people and I did learn from a few of those posts, but I'd rather go to a subreddit specifically for that. 

So, is it possible to block those posts or is there a lot of people willing to make a new subreddit for everything AMD except mundane builds (things you just buy online and put together)?  

I imagine this topic must appear a lot from time to time (or maybe I'm really the only one who thinks that), but I've never seen it, at least on my front page. And I've been around for a while..

Anyway, thanks, and remember I'm not ordering anything around, just seeing where we can get.

At the moment  I got the MSI B450 Carbon Pro and Asus B450 Strix-F in mind. 

It seems that MSI motherboard is highly recommended due to its VRM however it does not have voltage offset. 

What sort of performance gain will I see when comparing to motherboard that has voltage offset. Is it an issue for not having voltage offset option. Is the stock cooler good enough for XFR2/PBO overclocking.

While Fujitsu still only has PCIe 3 in this engineering sample, it seems pretty likely that would be upgraded to PCIe 4  by 2020  also.  Moving the RAM onto the package cuts the package pins by 3/4 with over 6x the memory bandwidth, likely with lower latency as well.

Moving the RAM onto the package cuts the package pins by 3/4 with over 6x the memory bandwith, likely with lower latency as well.

Oracle's layoffs of Sparc64 / Solaris engineers also means that platform is likely dead at least for the time being, It's more likely we'd see the rise of RISC-V to replace it than for Fujitsu to continue development on it alone. [https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/tech-careers/rip-sparc-and-solaris](https://spectrum.ieee.org/view-from-the-valley/at-work/tech-careers/rip-sparc-and-solaris)

That probably means EPYC 3  will be offered on a more dense socket  perhaps in addition to the SP3 socket, possibly HBM2 or 3  on package It seems there is probably room for at least 2 stacks of HBM, that would imply that it would need to be HBM3 to beat Fujitsu's 4 HMB2 stacks. And either PCIe 4.0 or PCIe 5.0 by that time. AVX 512 is also a likely addition as all HPC CPUs will have that feature by then.

AMD could also implement this as a gigantic HBM L4 cache on package, for applications that need it, and omit it for those that don't leaving them with just the 8 so so channels of DDR4 or DDR5 bandwidth.

Risky crossfire of two R9 Fury (but in one package)... and in theory I could also run two separate R9 Furies at x16/x16 too with 1920X that is on the build bench right now :)
* **Zotac GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Mini** \- 510 EUR, mostly ex-miner cards, some boxed new overstock (this model seems to have been used a lot). Loosing freesync on 1440 ultrawide. Will likely run hot (**Aeorus waterforce** with water cooling - 770 EUR where as FPS rather won't change much).
* **Vega FE 16GB HBM2** \- auction, at minimum it will be 460-480 EUR. Stock cooler design (will be hot/loud?).
* **Sapphire Nitro+ Radeon RX Vega 64** \- 610 EUR new. This thing is huge!
* **Vega 64 Liquid** \- 625 EUR, maybe bit less, open to offers ;)

What would you pick or avoid? It's mostly for 3440 X 1440 gaming, but not in all or most demanding games.

I was a bit conflicted because its so close to earnings time, but since it went under $25 today I dipped back in for about 20 more shares.   I called it would possibly get back around $25 at earnings time but since its already done it, theres a better chance it may rise come earnings.   Over $30 come earnings time and I would be wary...

Also I do not have on board graphics to try and fix it that way. I can't install Drivers for the 580 or 380 because the only way to get a signal to my display is by using an old HD4000 or a 750TI and I can't install those drivers with those cards "

I've had this graphics card for a while now (amd radeon rx580 4gb) and i like it but i don't really feel like it is as good as everybody says. for an example when i play gta v with max/ultra graphics on a 1080p monitor my fps barely scratches 50 and is often around 35-45. When everybody else test gta v with amd radeon rx580 4gb they seem to get around 70-80.

In some other games like battlefield v i don't really seem to see any differens on my fps even if i play on ultra or lowest.

I am currently calculating what an upgrade to Ryzen and a new GPU would cost me.

I am trying to get the most out of my CPU, so I want the best Ram for my money (16GB). I know already that I should focus on Single Rank Modules and high speed.
But should I focus on better timings or better Clocks?

For example:
For the same price I could get 2x8GB 3200(CL 16,18,18) or 2x8GB 3466(CL 19,23,23), which one would net me more performance?

The Ram iv got isnt b-die, I can run it at 3000 with very tight timings (14 15 15 15 32) but I am not sure if I am not losing some potential there.

The benchmarks are rather good so far (excep tfirestrike with very low combined score - 7k for some reason).

The temps are meh, 40-60 idle 70-82 under load - stock paste
 
I can overclock the cpu in ryzen master to 4,2 ghz with 1,5v but its not stable, isittbe bad motherboard or meh 2700x unit? 

Shell i swap out the board and ram? (would go for crosshair hero vii or some cheaper asus) Or is the rig ok like it is and I just need some more cooling?

Thanks for reading and your help, cheers

1) Sapphire RX 580 Nitro+ 4Gb at ~230€
2) A good variety of 580s 8Gb or 1060s 6Gb all near the 310 euros.
3) Go for a step up and take a 1070ti for ~460€, Vega 56 ~470€ or Vega 64 ~510€.

I use a 40"" 4K tv as monitor but i don't mind to play at 1080p the most demanding games as i have it mainly for a big screen estate for working. Right now i'm almost sold on the 580 4Gb, i saw many benches and seems like the difference between the 4 and the 8Gb isn't so big, usually a bunch of FPS, but i'm not quite sure about the step up for the vega's or the 1070ti.

I would like to hear some advice before pull the trigger on my second Polaris. Should i go for the cheaper one or i'm about to make a mistake? Is Polaris still a good choice? How good will be the improvement going for the pricey cards?"

I've used AMD in the past (AMD Athlon 6000 or something like that), and it did not disappoint me for many years.

Another thing to point out is that I'm also a programmer, I'm a C++ programmer that works with Visual Studio, so I need a lot of cores and threading so my computer does not slows down, say; I'm programming, debugging my program and also gaming at the same time (Overwatch &amp; League of Legends), so my computer must be fast at all times!

Asus appears to be generally dismissive of the platform which leaves the Gigabyte (Aorus Xtreme) and MSI (MEG Creation) x399 boards to choose from.

&amp;#x200B;

Hardware wise, I've read most of the reviews and see that the MSI board clearly has the better VRM setup (although from what I can tell the Gigabyte setup should still be plenty for overclocking the 2950x, right?), although the MSI has to trade a PCI slot for it.

&amp;#x200B;

What I want to know (and what most reviews seem to skim over) is who has the better support/drivers/BIOS between Gigabyte and MSI? Can either of them do XFR/PBO? Do either of them have any well-known issues/glitches? Do either of them have terrible (historical) reliability for issues/support?

So, IL 2 Sturmovik Battle of Stalingrad is the main game that I play. I think i have a good PC but the performance isn't that so good. It's knowed that this title is CPU-bound, okay, but isn't acceptible that I can't achieve 75 FPS in that PC and that i can perceive stuttering when looking to ground in this game;

After take off, all the time that I'm looking to the ground, the terrain is tremulous and seems like micro-slides (paused sequencial images), so, here my PC is getting stuttering. I've tryed enable and disable all Sync that you can imagine (FRTC, Chill, FreeSync, VSync, RivaTurner FPS Cap)

I've read about enable Vsync in game + FreeSync, others say to enable just the FreeSyc and disable Vsync..

I would like to know how to minimize, in the correct way, this stutterings.

&amp;#x200B;

To complement my issues list, I can't achieve 75 FPS when I playing IL 2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad on Ultra Settings; When I'm at ground, taxiing or rolling the FPS stay around 61\~69. After take off it stabilize at 75 FPS.

As this title is CPU-bound, I believe that with overclock i can achieve a little bit more FPS but I don't know how to overclock via P-States, i don't want to do overclock with fixed voltage.

* The minimum is a GTX 660 or an R9 285. Wait, what? Yes. This Radeon R9 285 which in 2018 kicks the snot out of a GTX **9**60 is now equal to a GTX **6**60. Apparently.
* Recommended for 1080p 60fps is a GTX 970 or an R9 290X. Again, why Ubisoft? The R9 290X easily trades blows with the GTX 980, but now it's knocked down a tier.
* Recommended for 4K 30 fps is a GTX 1080 or an RX Vega 64. Here we see two GPU's which are usually quite close to each other. But:

This really smells like AMD's driver can't handle Odyssey well, like we've seen with Origins to a large extent as well. Especially at the lower resolution and the minimum requirements, the large performance difference between the listed AMD and Nvidia GPU's is a not-so-subtle hint that absolutely no effort went into optimizing and better threading the AnvilNext 2.0 Engine.

If things are indeed as bad a my rant above here claims, then why is AC: Odyssey part of AMD's promotion deal with the 3-pack game bundle? Honestly, I have no idea. There is the ever so small chance that a DX12-patch will be published by Ubisoft later on, but I wouldn't bet any money on this. Thanks for reading, I'm curious to read your opinion as well."

Amd,LittleVulpix,16,20,"2400G (and probably 2200G as well) show very erratic scores in 3Dmark physics test(s)It took me a while to dig through the relevant information, especially because I cannot actually see any frequency change on the cpu or the gpu, but apparently because the power is budgeted between the two parts, this can cause stuttery mess and similar behavior in synthetic tests (and well I guess later on in normal tasks if they are similar)

The stupidest part is that if I set the Cloud Gate test on loop, then by the time it gets to like 2nd / 3rd loop, it's fairly stable. High FPS all around. But the first time it runs the benchmark, the FPS sometimes dips to like 3-5, other times in low 10s. (normally around 40ish during the demanding part of the benchmark). 

If you have 3Dmark and a 2400g, give it a go. It looks stupid and it took me a while to figure out it's not a bug; that despite voltages being set properly, despite locked multiplier (38x) and proper other settings, this still happens. Is there something that can be done about it? I tried latest bios for my board (b450 msi gaming ac) but no difference really.

I guess for some reason this test uses a bit of GPU (I saw the utilization), and that just triggers the internal power division mechanism.

I recorded a bit of it. First run gets terrible towards the end (fps dipping below 10). Second run is bad in the middle but becomes ok towards the end. Remaining runs seem okay.

It triggers me a little bit because because of this randomness I'm pretty sure some outlets gave 2400G a lot worse score than it deserves.

Amd,Mycroft2046,8,1,"Overclocking problems and insane VCore - Ryzen 1700The system is Ryzen 1700 on an Asus Strix X370-F ROG motherboard with 16GB 3200 MHz RAM. The VCore is manually set to 1.1V and CPU frequency is set to 3.5GHz, with LLC set to Level 1. Ryzen SenseMI is turned off. In Windows 10, power plan is set to Ryzen Blanaced.

To check the stability, I ran Intel Burn test, but it constantly locked up the system. On Ubuntu, I ran various configs of stress-ng including -matrix 0 for more than 3 hours each.

Then on Windows, I ran Prime95 Blend Test for about 2 hours. The temperature soared up to 72 degree Celcius, but that was to be expected with stock cooler and ambient temp of upwards of 30 degrees.

Unfortunately, Intel Burn Test still locked up the system in Maximum settings.

At last, I wanted to give OCCT a try.

It was running fine when I noticed something odd. [OCCT  reported an insane amount of VCore using built-in sensor (HWMonitor).](https://imgur.com/a/RWtiOBZ) I used HWinfo in conjunction with OCCT, and according to HWinfo, the VCore remained at a steady 1.1V, sometimes drooping or spiking just a little bit. But OCCT reported surges upto 2.18V.

Surely, that is wrong, right? I am, by the way, using the latest version of OCCT.

As an aside, if the system fails to pass IBT, should I increase the VCore by .05V?

&amp;#x200B;

i measured using AMD's uProf and using furmark CPU and GPU burner testing.. (separately)  and got same results...scale is set for wattage as value (it clips off and cant scroll)

&amp;#x200B;

the Socket0 VDD.. = iGPU (vega 10) and pulls a peak of 5.67 watts

&amp;#x200B;

the Socket0 Sock.. = CPU and pulling 27.72 watts

&amp;#x200B;

together this is beyond 30 watts...makes some sense as the charger pulling 50 watts while at load via power meter its plugged into

&amp;#x200B;

this proves a horrible power balance no matter what i tried, the highest i could get on iGPU was 6.2 watts, the cpu even under reduced frequencies but at load get upwards of 27 watts!   this caused a rapid thermal throttle on iGPU everytime, not the CPU... (this graph is only showing me starting and stopping the gpu then cpu testing and getting same wattage results)

&amp;nbsp;

GTX 1080(KFA2 EX OC) really silent at idle. I liked it. But it produces too much heat(under load) inside my case. Runs hot, noisy and ruins my case. 

&amp;nbsp;

Vega 64 LC has bad pump noise at idle. It ruins the silence of the case. But it's silent and cooler when playing a game. It doesn't increase my case temps. Radiator works as exhaust. This is really good luxury. I can't use air gpu's anymore. Liquid-hybrid aftermarket or custom loop is best. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also RX Vega 64 LC looks really good. It's really special and awesome gpu. I will use it to decorate my room when it gets retired.

&amp;nbsp;

Power consumption(Battlefield V):


7700k 1.3v 4.9ghz + gtx 1080= Average 260-270W.


7700k 1.3v 4.9ghz + vega 64 lc=  400-440W. Power consumption is not stable with this. It jumps like core clocks.

Notes:


ALL GAMES TESTED AT 1440P


1- GR Wildlands: Maxed settings, Gameworks features off, built-in benchmark.


2- AC Origins: Maxed, built-in benchmark. Bad game, bad optimization imo. Next one(AC:Odyssey) will be polished version of this. Damn Ubisoft...


3- Witcher 3: Just a short gameplay. Numbers may not be super accurate. I can say Vega noticeably better when hairworks on, but just slightly better when hairworks off. This is interesting. Vega better at hairworks lol.


4- Rise of the tomb raider: Pascal really good at this game. Built-in benchmark used. All settings maxed manually. Highest preset is not maxed setting in this game. I think maxed settings enables some Nvidia optimized gimmicky graphics.


5- Shadow of War: Maxed settings. Built-in benchmark used. Vega much better imo.


6- FC Primal: Maxed settings built in benchmark.


7- Hitman: Maxed DX12 built in benchmark.


8- Battlefield V: Maxed settings HDR. I played a lot. Vega offers much smoother experience in this game. This game has amazing HDR and graphics. Sadly i wasnt able to disable HDR because it's unfinished open beta. So no SDR benchmarks. 


9- Far Cry 5: Maxed, built in benchmark. Vega clear winner here. Surprisingly gtx 1080 doesn't lose performance when HDR enabled.


10- SW Battlefront 2: Short gameplay. Vega numbers better but gtx 1080 was much more smoother. This game didnt liked my gpu switch. It did weird shader optimization. Stutters observed with Vega. I think if i install this game after installing Vega it will be smooth. I played this game before. It was super smooth with my Vega.


11- F1 2017: Built in benchmark, maxed settings. 


12- Arkham knight: Built in benchmark, maxed settings. Gameworks off. Console port lol. Vega crashes gtx 1080 here. I can't enable gameworks. It's locked to Nvidia. So no comparison.


13- Wolfenstein 2: Maxed settings short gameplay.


14- Battlefield 1: Maxed HDR, short gameplay.

&amp;nbsp;

I didnt tested it here but Vega gains a lot of performance from HBM2 overclock. It's more like tweak actually. Free performance. 

+%50 power limit can't bring worthy performance but undervolting helps.


Pascal really good overclocker. Overclocked gtx 1080 under water (hybrid aftermarket or custom loop) should be good.


I feel like Vega has much better hardware and big potential but games more optimized for gtx 1080.


Sorry for my english. I hope it's understandable.

I really want to overclock my Ryzen 7 1700, even just .1 or .2 GHz is fine, because with all the cores and threads, I want its single core to be a bit better, as it's mixed core is great.

SIGGRAPH is the annual conference of all things computer graphics, and a great time to share what we've been working on all year.  We are really excited in the AMD ProRender team to share some of the new stuff and were here to answer any questions users might have about the developments.

____________________________
First off, updates to our Radeon ProRender plugins for 3DSMax, Maya and Blender.  If you are not familiar, these are plugin renderers we provide for various animation and design applications, aimed at giving high quality physically based renders on OpenCL supporting GPUs (across hardware vendors.)

These plugins are all updated and can be downloaded from https://pro.radeon.com/en/radeon-pro-software/ and are a great intro to what raytracing on the GPU can be.

Some notable features:

* Updated and optimized export on all plugins, particularly with complex scenes with instancing.  

* More responsive interactive rendering

* Simplified render settings

* Ambient occlusion shader node https://i.imgur.com/cAybo5h.jpg

* Ability to enable or disable caustics for faster or more precise glass rendering https://i.imgur.com/krYZ43X.jpg

* Updated Uber shaders.  Uber is our main shader, and we've added features to give artists even more freedom.  Some highlights:

Diffuse Backscattering (useful for thin materials like leaves) https://i.imgur.com/uFIKrI9.jpg


Clearcoat thickness.  Clearcoat is often used like a ""lacquer"" type layer on surface, think a layer on a basketball court.  Now you can simulate the thickness and color of the substrate all in the shader. https://i.imgur.com/9bSJGjR.jpg

Separated normal parameters.  Simplified SSS, and more.


____________________________
PTC Creo plugin.  Higher quality rendering directly PTC Creo 4 to visualize what your CAD data might look in real life.


____________________________
Beta for Unreal Engine plugin.  Last year at SIGGRAPH we showed a demo of a plugin renderer right inside Unreal Studio.  We would have loved to get this into users hands earlier, but wanted to make sure it was of good quality first.  This will be a gamechanger for the up and coming users of UE for data visualization and animation.

____________________________
Support for Pixar's open source USD system.  USD is becoming THE interchange format for animation software, and what most movie studios are building their pipeline around.  By providing higher quality, raytraced rendering in the viewport, artists can gain a better visual of their scene, at a point where they may have previously been working with wireframes.
See a short clip of this working here:  

____________________________
Cloud rendering.  We don't want to spill all the beans on this yet, but come by the AMD booth (we'll have video later) to see our demo with Genesis Cloud.

____________________________
Hybrid Raytracing.  Back at GTC we talked about hybrid rasterization and raytracing in Vulkan.  We will be showing this in real live action, so come by our booth or stay tuned for updates as the weeks go on!

____________________________
Application integration of Radeon ProRender.  The Foundry's Modo just opened a beta for the integrated Radeon ProRender 

https://community.foundry.com/discuss/topic/142317/amd-radeon-prorender-public-beta-is-now-available-for-modo-maintece-and-subscription-licensees

As well as Maxon's Cinema4D announcing R20 with significantly improved Radeon ProRender support
https://www.maxon.net/en/products/new-in-release-20/prorender/

The last three features I mentioned are aimed at making it easier for applications to integrate Radeon ProRender, so if you're interested in seeing it in your app, let the developers know, we'd love to talk to them!

Thanks to the developers who worked tirelessly on all of the above.  There's more info to come over the next week, but we wanted to open up to questions and connect with users.

Generally a lot of people everywhere, youtube, this subreddit etc are saying it is between these two boards for mATX B450m boards. What do you guys think is better? Can you help me decide. I am open to other suggestions to in the mATX B450M area.

I should also note, that I am going to pair the motherboard with a 2600X and in 2020 I shall be upgrading to the final AM4 CPU that comes out. Saying that I am not sure if I will be upgrading my motherboard aswell. I doubt it but it is a possibility.  Therefore if I don''t upgrade my motherboard I want my current one to have the best chance of running the new CPUs, which means I might need to get the best one with VRMs? But at the same time I don't want that to be a deciding factor sooo much. 

I appreciate any help you guys can give me. Thanks."

Hello guys!

This week I have decided that I am going to upgrade my PC and am jumping on the Ryzen train. After much research due to my current case only being able to handle mATX boards, I have come down to these two mother boards.

The MSI B450M

[https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B450M-MORTAR](https://www.msi.com/Motherboard/B450M-MORTAR)

The ASRock B450M Pro 4

[https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450M%20Pro4/index.asp](https://www.asrock.com/MB/AMD/B450M%20Pro4/index.asp)

Generally a lot of people everywhere, youtube, this subreddit etc are saying it is between these two boards for mATX B450m boards. What do you guys think is better? Can you help me decide. I am open to other suggestions to in the mATX B450M area.

I should also note, that I am going to pair the motherboard with a 2600X and in 2020 I shall be upgrading to the final AM4 CPU that comes out. Saying that I am not sure if I will be upgrading my motherboard aswell. I doubt it but it is a possibility. Therefore if I don''t upgrade my motherboard I want my current one to have the best chance of running the new CPUs, which means I might need to get the best one with VRMs? But at the same time I don't want that to be a deciding factor sooo much.

I appreciate any help you guys can give me. Thanks."

My motherboard’s a Strix B350-F Gaming.
I’ve read several threads of people with the same Mobo encounter problems where their Rx 580’s not displaying signal or being disabled(just- problems- kinds of problems)

Only thing I’ve come to is that the Rx 580 needs a Mobo that supports UEFI(did I get that right?) and maybe my Strix B350-F doesn’t support UEFI? I’m currently in a different city so I can’t check if my Mobo supports UEFI—but best to ask from the more experienced people here:

Will there any be problems I’ll encounter if use an Rx 580, on my Strix B350-F Gaming motherboard? "

Amd,brokemyacct,51,16,"so.. i got both 13 inch and 15 inch HP Envy X360 (refreshed models i guess?)1st thing is first..  both showing up on CPU-Z as 15 watts TDP...  disappointing if true since 15 inch model has extra room and fatter heatpipe..  and with some basic benchmarks, i think i have confirmed that indeed, the 15 (refreshed?) and 13 inch models are identical in performance.   this could be the new 15 inch model has a reduced TDP... this comes across as a bit of a scummy tactic to me if true.. lack of consistency here

2nd thing.. new 15 inch models do not by default comes with dual channel memory.. i have little to no idea why, but to me seems suspicious since they introduced these models with dual channel and review samples and early adopter samples appeared to all be dual channel..     this to me is on the level of Nvidia GT-1030 4GB scam....  no way to identify it very easily as refreshed model with reduced specs..    SIDENOTE: i got 3200Mhz ddr4 sodimm from a friend to test, and.... nota.. 2400Mhz detected..weirdly clocks voltage and everything match the samsung stick was in the machine... a bit too much, could mean that bios is only setup to report one set of specs..?  that seems very stupid and almost suspicious..

3rd thing.. 15 inch model is very heavy they claim 4.48pounds..  but i dont think it has to be that heavy.., when i tore it apart, no real clear indication of why.. once got board, battery and all extra bits out.. i figured out a lot of the weight appears to be in the screen/hinge area..i think... i couldn't find anything else to pull out..so consider the 13 inch model weights as much as the 15 inch screen/hinge system alone.. or think of it the other way around..  that 15 inch's screen/hinge weighs as much as the entire 13 inch variant of the laptop. thats insane..  

4th point:  15 inch system is noticeably quieter...like silent.    even under stressful loads..  and i cant feel much air blowing out unless i punish the APU with 100% load on both CPU and iGPU.  could be because the APU is limited to 15 watts for some stupid reason and the cooling system was built for 25 watts..  or i..i dont know.    temps overall...appear to be the same.. just quieter..

5th point.. i hat the keyboard layout on the 15 inch model... i hate off center keys, most everyone dont need a numpad.. the trackpad being centered with the keyboard letters and thus offcentered with the chassis trigger my moderate OCD, most than i realized it would...   also i am not a fan of the feedback.. its firm but gives in suddenly and lacks feel i thin, also being off center i mistype A LOT!

6th point: by default if you get 256GB SSD variant with no HDD you get 256GB M.2 SSD.. it is NVMe, however only rated for sata speeds (6gb/sec so not an awesome trade off).   you cannot easily upgrade to add a 2.5inch SSD/HDD..  HP removed the ribbon cable and rubber HDD caddy.. i hate when they do that, just leave the caddy and tape ribbon down... the only reason for 15 inch model is mostly down to upgradability...stop fucking with that, OEMs..  the 2.5"" bay is still there as is the ribbon connector snap piece.. either fill the bay with battery, or leave the caddy and ribbons... or make the 15 inch model thinner and lighter..

7th point u would like to make, battery life appears to be better.. but i only owned this machine for a few days...  i dont know exactly how much better as my texting is real world based on watching youtube and browsing and a few games and netflix..  i would say its better but not worth getting 15 inch model for battery life ...like maybe 30 minutes better.. this could just be down to me messing up drivers on the 13 inch... its close enough that i would still say if battery life is a consideration, take the 13 inch..

final point: audio quality:  13 inch wins...  quad speakers and extra depth but not hugely.. these B&amp;O speakers on the 15 inch sound like shit... i played same music side by side and the 13 inch sounds better... to confirm i blindfolded my GF and played samples of her music over it with 15 inch X360, her macbook pro, and 13 inch X360.  and she honestly confused her macbook pro speakers with 13 inch X360 more times than i could believe.  but she hated on the 15 inch for sounding tinny and thin..  

OEM drivers: cinebench R15:  609 multi, 134 single ; OpenGL: 34.80 FPS

AMD standard Drivers: N/A.... black screens :( i tried Rx Vega, both Vega 11 options, Vega 8.. no Vega 10 option..

i know i sound like im hating on the 15 inch envy X360..... because i am, the newly refreshed models, suck..

ways i figured out you an ell.. if it has the damascus steel pattern around back side of the hinge area on 15 inch model and if 256GB SSD + 8GB system memory is the default config... it is the new refreshed model..   the 13 inch models all have these default options.."

I built my son a new PC and it runs great -- the AMD proc dynamically changes it's speed (according to task manager &gt; performance tab) and clocks up and down constantly.

However, the computer will go to sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity, as intended via the high power settings that I have configured.

Problem:  Once the machine wakes up from sleep, task manager shows the CPU clock @ 0.54 GHz and stays there.  I don't mean it's *displaying* incorrectly but this seems to be the actual speeds when it wakes up according to CPUZ as well.

The video card is a GTX 1050 and is running all games at a high frame rate, nice and smooth, without issue.  When it wakes out of sleep and the CPU is stuck @ 0.54GHz, *everything* runs like complete shit as would be expected with the CPU ""pretend-bottlenecking"" everything.

Amd,Sxotts,31,0,"Ryzen Floating Point Performance Drop in SMTFirst post, so apologies for formatting and such.

For my thesis, I ran a self made N-body Gravitational Simulator on my system to demonstrate benefits to writing programs to run in parallel. This is a program that is heavily floating point dependent. I ran this on my own personal system with a Ryzen 5 1600X with varying data set sizes and varying the number of threads the program would run on. Looking at the data, there was a weird slowdown when going from 6 to 7 threads, as shown bellow:

https://i.redd.it/tbl041w23m911.png

I had a hunch that this might have something to do with the Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT). To confirm this, I accessed the BIOS is ran the program in 4-thread mode with my system made to simulate a Quad core/Quad thread (SMT Off), and as a Dual Core/Quad thread (SMT On). The results are shown below:

https://i.redd.it/dhpmo4ubzl911.png

There is a consistent 35&amp;#37; - 38&amp;#37; performance deficit with SMT on vs SMT off. My actual thesis describes all this in better detail, but i thought this would be a good piece of information to have on this sub. This may be the reasoning as to why AMD recommended disabling SMT for better Gaming Performance 

TL;DR: Though experimentation, I found that Ryzen (first Gen) appears to have a \~37&amp;#37; drop in floating point performance on Simulated threads while using SMT. May be why AMD Recommends turning SMT off for better Game Performance.

Amd,Technocian,0,1,"7850k. GPU overclock won't apply, sticks to stock 720 mhz, no tuning in bios.I have a 7850k that I have been meaning to put a mild OC on at stock voltages.

The first problem I ran into was when I updated the drivers to the latest ones offered by AMD. In GPU-Z I noticed it wasn't even throttling up to stock speeds. Quick research showed the last drivers that work with this chip was 15.6 beta (lol wtf? These drivers are like 2 years old). Anyways, I reverted back to the recommended drivers and it was throttling between idle and 720 mhz just fine again.

I don't have bios level support for overclocking the iGPU, only thr CPU, so I figured I would give AMD Overdrive a shot. Using the slider I can select any frequency and apply it, but even measly 10 mhz overclocks all produce the same result. A screen blink, a clock change in GPU-Z, and then a shift back to 720 mhz 5 seconds later. I've tried both AMD Overdrive and MSI Afterburner to no avail.

What am I doing wrong? I'm on the latest Windows 10, stock everything, hardware and software all stable. Just no ability to keep a GPU OC after reboot or for any extended period of time."

My problem is that my Fury X is downclocking to 300Mhz. I saw in HWiNFO that a Sensor is reporting 200c Liquid Temp.

![img](6d2oemntvo911 ""Every time it Spikes to 200 the GPU clockts down... sometimes the Sensor fails (report noting) and then the Clock is ok (1050Mhz)"")

Ive asked in the Supportthread if some one know to fix this issue... i got now answers so i done a little reseach by my own. 

![img](5zymcs7luo911 ""It turned out that the PCB of the Fury X (Water Cooled) and Fury (Air Cooled) is the Same, the only diffrence is a  socket"")

![img](zov6so9epo911 ""So it seems that the GPU Liquid Temp-Sensor must connect with it:"")

![img](y4k5j9nqpo911 ""So the Sensor must be in the \""PumbBox\"". Over the pump is a PCB so the Sensore must be connected to the PCB"")

![img](gacqe85vuo911 ""And on the Backside of the PCB ther it is... the Attached sensor."")

![img](xwll6v72vo911 ""It goes between the Copperplate and the PumpBox. "")

So i will just cut off the Sensor an hope that it will work :) 

From my perspective it shoud, its the only Sensor that is connected to the GPU-PCB and the only diffrence between a Fury and a Fury X is the AIO. Also when the Sensor noting reports the GPU-Clock is @ normal (1050Mhz). 

So i will update this Post after im finished:) wish me luck.

Amd,Pimpmuckl,16,8,"High end ultrabooks with 2500U/2700U?Hello r/AMD,

I'm currently looking around for something to replace my older XPS 13 9350 (i7-6500U) and I'm more than happy with the XPS13 in general apart from the aging dual core.

Now the thing that really annoys me is that, while Dell has a refresh 8th gen with 8550U, it still majorly lacks graphics power and I'd like to play a bit of Dota 2 or World of Warcraft when out travelling.

So, naturally, I was looking around for a comparable 2700U-based ""ultra""book and I'm somewhat disappointed how little options there are with 15-25W Ryzen CPUs in the high end market that have dual channel and have good battery life.

There's a good chance I'm missing something, so if you have some experiences with 13 inch ultra portables I'd love some recommendations."
Amd,defiancecp,85,201,"Vega 64 crossfire scaling testing in 24 games &amp; 5 benchmarks - requests for more welcome. also pics :)First the pretty :) https://imgur.com/a/hOh8x1F

But more importantly, the info -- With vega used prices finally dropping to slightly less insane, I finally got a 2nd to try out crossfire.  Some notes on the testing:

* For testing, I ran all tests just before the install, installed the second card, enabled crossfire, and ran the same tests.  Sometimes these tests weren't the highest I've had before, but they were all in reasonable range.  I assumed driver changes and windows updates and a million other things may have impacted results, so best to have a confirmed recent baseline.
* apparently no hbcc with crossfire; the option just goes away.
* I've got a 360 and 240 radiator, though the flow from the 240 is relatively obstructed so it's probably about as effective as a 120.  Not enough, in other words, for a 2700x with 103.5bclk and a pair of overclocked vegas.  So while both cards are stable at the same settings as my single  card, they aren't stable long term - build up too much heat.  Within a couple minutes I can feel the heat radiating from my reservoir...  No bueno! 
* As a result, the clocks are different.  Specifically:
* single card: clocks were 1650/1135, with +75% power limiter.  generally the core clock stays in the 1630s.
* crossfire: clocks were 1580/1135, with +10% power limiter.  Generally clocks are in the 1520s.
* Tested: 5 benchmarks and 24 games
* general note: I ran into a few games that I *KNOW* benefited from xf with my old 480 setup, but had no benefit with vega...  No idea why.  I hope to revisit those.
* Excepting things that are set to a specific resolution, the below were set to 4k res, highest detail levels.  Vsync always off, and I disabled AA.  Some exceptions out there, which I noted.
* For games without benchmarks, I use a specific save or mission right after loading, etc (noted).  This isn't a good versatile test, it's only meant to get a general impression of scaling.

7 games have odd results as noted in each row.  I'll be cleaning up/retesting these asap.  | - | - | - | -


So to summarize:
* WORKING EASY: 46% of games // 55% of apps tested -- All 5 benches worked great (needed to set a profile for 2, &lt;5 minutes).  11 of the 24 games (46%) worked perfectly with no manual intervention required.  Average scaling for these is 60%.  That mixed; restricting it to games would probably drop it to the 55% range (the benchmarks were generally higher than average scaling).
* UNSUPPORTED: 25% of games // 21% of apps tested -- 6 of the games were clearly not supported and didn't scale.
* SUPPORTED, BUT NEEDS CONFIGURATION: 29% of games // 24% of apps tested -- another 7 games SHOULD scale based on published benchmarks, but didn't in the 5-10 minutes I gave to them on a first-pass.  In one case it was a crash, another the settings were all jacked up in the game, but mostly it was just no improvement.
* I had a few games I'd planned to test but couldn't for various reasons - GTA-V and RE:5 in particular.  I don't have them, but my son does, so I was using his steam account - he apparently changed his password, so I need to track him down and get an update :)  From memory, I think both of those actually scale well.  

I'll post a follow-up with my experience troubleshooting the problem children and maybe adding in the extra missing ones.  If anyone has another game, app, or benchmark they'd like to see, let me know and I'll try.  Not going to spend a bunch of money on games I don't have, though - feel free to call out anything in my steam profile ( https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989969666/games/?tab=all ), or if something's cheap and fun I'm probably willing to grab it and try.


**CONCLUSIONS SO FAR:**

I've frequently been a defender of crossfire, as my previous experiences with it have been overwhelmingly good.  This time ... they weren't as good.  In the past I've needed to expend almost no effort to get them working, and a substantial majority of the games I tried worked effortlessly, with a small group I'd need to tweak.  This time, it looks like the group needing tweaking is quite a bit larger (25% of the games).  If I get them all working, it'll get me up to 71% of games, which is about what I expect from xf, but I really expected to have to do a lot less effort to get there.

Anyway, so I guess the big conclusion here is that there's still quite a bit to gain from crossfire, but if this is consistent with the average, it looks like today you can expect about 50% of games to work easy, and maybe another 20% with some effort - and scaling should be in the 55-60% above single-card performance range."

A couple of weeks ago I reported an issue that I stumbled upon where having a hardware accelerated video running while there is a game running in the background would lead to the GPU getting stuck on certain core and/or memory clocks, which can only be reset by rebooting. This may present in form of the GPU not advancing beyond certain frequencies anymore or not decreasing to appropriate power state when going idle.
A friendly user had given me the hint when I couldn't figure out some odd behavior my GPU showed.


Well, in the 17.7.1 update, that exact issue showed up in the known issues section. That obviously doesn't mean it's fixed, but they do read and investigate bug reports. If you experience certain issues, send them a ticket. The more information they get from the users, the easier underlying bugs get identified.

His rig was also an introduction to PC for me but our profession roads splitted later on, he is working in frontend, I'm a SysAdmin and Hardware Tech Support.


His last rig was a: Intel Pentium (133mhz), 32MB of RAM (EDO or SDRAM), HDD Segate 700MB and Windows98SE (old good memories...)


Later on he used some trash laptops over years (dumpster dive class of laptops...) and recently one of them just set on fire so he decided to build PC one more time.


We decided on: Ryzen 2600, ASROCK AB350 PRO4, 16GB (2x8GB) rated 3200MHz, PCIe NVMe 512GB, 4TB HDD, 750W PSU (just to have an extra room for GPU and CPU upgrade later on) and here is the question about GPU.


**(TLTR)** My brother do not game, mby max NES emulator and Megaman collection on it. He would like to buy 4K monitor (with freesync) just to watch some movies and just because 4K is glorious for programmers so GPU with HDMI 2.0 is required. He would like to connect 2nd 1080p screen to it (in pivot) so 2nd HDMI would be nice, if not, there are adapters DP-HDMI on the market so not a big deal. I'm looking for your opinion about GPUs. 


I can get him one of these cards **for free**:

RX 460 2GB, 7950 3GB, R9 270X 4GB, R9 280 3GB, R9 285 OC 2GB , R7 370 2GB

Amd,brain_chaos,1,1,"AMD Freesync question for 60 hz monitor/consoleI've been trying to research this but haven't had much success.  Can anyone tell me if enabling the variable refresh rate (freesync) on my xbox one x will have a positive or negative effect on input lag for a game like fortnite?  I have the BenQ El287ou monitor.  From what I've read, it seems like freesync wouldn't kick it unless the framerate dropped a few frames below 60...since fortnite is pretty solid 60 on my xbox x i'm guessing it is just plain vsync most of the time.  

bonus question.  it could be placebo but if I disable 4K resolution on my console and go with 1440 or 1080p, it seems like input lag may be further reduced or more snappy.  This seems counter-intuitive to what I've read though because now the monitor is scaling up a 1080p signal to a native 4k monitor.  thoughts?  "

[So it seems that the GPU Liquid Temp-Sensor must connect with it:](https://i.redd.it/zxdro5hdvr911.jpg)

[So the Sensor must be in the \\""PumbBox\\"". Over the pump is a PCB so the Sensore must be connected to the PCB](https://i.redd.it/5uajmmuevr911.jpg)

You have to **Open the Topplate** and **remove the Plastic around the PumpBlock** (Lift it up whit a Screwdriver) after this two steps just **cut the Sensor Cable on the Side**, Thats all.

The first problem I ran into was when I updated the drivers to the latest ones offered by AMD. In GPU-Z I noticed it wasn't even throttling up to stock speeds. Quick research showed the last drivers that work with this chip was 15.6 beta (lol wtf? These drivers are like 2 years old). Anyways, I reverted back to the recommended drivers and it was throttling between idle and 720 mhz just fine again.

I don't have bios level support for overclocking the iGPU, only the CPU, so I figured I would give AMD Overdrive a shot. Using the slider I can select any frequency and apply it, but even measly 10 mhz overclocks all produce the same result. A screen blink, a clock change in GPU-Z, and then a shift back to 720 mhz 5 seconds later. I've tried both AMD Overdrive and MSI Afterburner to no avail.

* \-Monitors go black (no signal)
* \-sound off
* \-Fans keep spinning
* \-Motherboard unresponsive (reset switch /power switch not working)
* \-To reboot the system I have to switch the PSU off and wait for 20-30 sec until the MoBo loses power. Only then the system boots as normal.

This ""crash"" happens at complete random like once every 24 hrs. It happens while gaming or while browsing the web.

I ran memtest86 over night - everythings OK, IntelBurnTest on maximum for 6 hrs- No Errors, Prime95 over night-all good. Temperatures did not go past 65 C since CPU runs at stock clocks. All Cables and connectors checked.

Amd,randomirritate,10,33,"Witcher 3 fixHi,

I found a solution that worked for me to fix Witcher 3 stuttering introduced in the december driver, the first version of adrenaline.

I don't think the issue will go away, my suspicion is that it is caused by the AMD overlay that cannot be turned off. The results I see seem to confirm this as without it the stuttering is gone. Another clue is that AMD removed it from the known issues list but it was never listed under fixed issues either, passively acknowledging (imho) that the game itself has issues with overlays.

Either way, my solution is to simply disable any and ALL overlays for this game, including steam/gog, win10 volume overlay and amd relive. Win10 overlay can be disabledper executable in properties (this is also the fix for Titanfall 2 global lighting issue BTW, youre welcome). AMD overlay can be disabled by killing the amd relive desktop application+host application.

I just came from a recent upgrade from my old rig.

I was was wondering why Ryzen chips spike exactly 10c every few seconds. It only surfaced when I downloaded the new drivers and used the Ryzen Balanced power plan.

I know its due to XFR but its just too damn consistent to be based on usage, like every 5-8 seconds consistent.

I checked other threads and the answers are all over the place. One thread said it was the bluetooth being turned on. Another thread said it was due to Ryzen Master, advised to check temps with it off (it's still the same 10c spike). My friends intel chip never did that even with turbo boost on. 

Thing is, I noticed it stops doing it whenever I change anything within the Ryzen Balanced power plan. If I change the min and or the max processor state to either mine 89 or max 99 or any other value less than the default it provided.

Should I leave it to the default of min 90 max 100. Or do I lose something if I change whatever AMD put in place.   "

Amd,xxPoLyGLoTxx,1,3,"Running 2700x in XFR versus all-core boostHi all,

I recently completed my first AMD build and I am loving the 2700x processor. It was a huge upgrade coming from an i5\-2500k! I've always been a ""tweaker"" at heart, and I've read through lots of posts about overclocking, XFR, core performance boost, etc. Here is what I am seeing...

**Stock XFR setup:**

With this, I see boosts up to 4.2 ghz\+ with voltage consistently spiking up to 1.45v\+. For some reason, that high voltage scares me a bit. I feel like it spends *too long* at those voltages. I realize it's the design of the chip and harmless (more than likely). The advantages of this setup are that it is hands off, letting the chip do the work and manage everything automatically. The downside, in my opinion, is that the voltages spike a lot and multi\-core performance suffers a bit compared to the next option (see below). Average cinebench score with this option is around 1740 (give or take).

**All\-core boost:**

With this, I can achieve a constant 4.1ghz at 1.275v on ***all cores***. The upside with this is that my cinebench score increases, temperatures stay nice and low, and I do not have to worry about any voltage spikes. This seems like a win\-win to me. I can push the chip to 4.2 ghz but the voltage needs a dramatic increase up to nearly 1.38 \- 1.4v and of course, this increases the max temperatures. Average cinebench score hovers around 1800.

**My uses:**

I should mention that for my daily uses, it really does not make much of a difference in terms of performance. I game, specifically lots of Overwatch, which is never going to tax my system. I also do video editing with 4k content, and this is where I am leaning toward the all\-core boost. I am assuming that higher cinebench scores correlate with faster rendering times. 

My main concerns with my chip is to keep it cool (low temperatures) and to get consistently good performance.

**Things I have not tried but I am interested in:**

I am interested in using a voltage offset with XFR, but I do not think my motherboard has this capability (see below for specs). If I could get XFR to work but keep the voltages at a max of say, 1.4v, that might be a good middle ground.

I am also very interested in memory overclocking, which seems to be great for Ryzen chips. If anyone can give me some pointers, I'd be very helpful! But again, my BIOS does not seem to have many overclocking capabilities but perhaps Ryzen Master could be good.

**Closing Thoughts:**

tl;dr \-\- A consistent all\-core boost seems better than XFR for a variety of reasons, including lower temperatures, faster cinebench scores, and lower voltages.

I realize that single core clock speeds might favor XFR, but to me that seems secondary to multi\-core speeds.

Amd,xxPoLyGLoTxx,317,346,"Just let Ryzen XFR work its magic - my experience (Ryzen 2700x)Hi all,

Before I dive in, let me give you a little back story. This is my first AMD cpu ever. I just recently upgraded from an i5\-2500k, and I am blown away by this processor. It handles everything I throw at it and is just downright awesome. The team at AMD should be very proud of their work.

If you are anything like me, **you like to ""tweak"" things**. You like to overclock, find the optimal settings, etc. You spend more time in your BIOS than you do using your computer, amirite? This was me up until 5 minutes ago. I was constantly tweaking things, running cinebench over and over, etc. I was obsessed with finding those ""perfect settings"" to give me the best of everything. 

Here's the thing: **You do not need to tweak anything with this processor. AMD has an algorithm that is so sophisticated that it would be a crime against humanity to disable it!!**

But wait? Wouldn't an all\-core boost be better than using XFR? In my mind, it had the potential pros of a consistent speed, higher possible multi\-core speed, and lower voltage on average. Sounds great on paper, right? So I tested it out. I achieved a stable 4.1ghz at 1.275v. I ran Aida64, tested memory, etc. and everything seemed stable. My cinebench score was around 1800 or so. I thought this was a terrific compromise of speed, temperatures, voltages, etc. Ha ha! I've found the ideal settings AMD, take that!

**But then I noticed something very peculiar:** I fired up a game of Overwatch. I run this game at ultra settings with everything maxed out (I have an accompanying 1070ti). I cap my frame rate at 120 fps because I'm still on a 60hz monitor (I know that is also considered a crime against humanity, but anyways...). I noticed something odd \- the game was running fine, but my frame rate was dropping slightly below 120. It was dipping down to 100 at times! This was unheard of when I first started playing the game.

**So I paused and reflected.** Why would my frame rate go down when my cinebench score had just gone up? This is bizarre!

**My first thought:** Maybe I need more voltage and (somehow) it is throttling my CPU. So I upped to 1.3v and tried again. The ""problem"" persisted.

**My second thought:** Maybe my single core speed is lower now given I am only running at 4.1ghz and XFR can hit 4.2ghz\+. So I went into my BIOS and reset my clock speed to let AMD handle it. Basically, I re\-enabled XFR and core performance boost, etc. 

And just to be super duper sure \- I reset my BIOS completely. **I wanted to run at stock settings on everything.** Once reset, I re\-enabled my XMP memory speed to get 3200mhz. I fired up my computer and tested Overwatch again.

**Here's where it got interesting:** Not only was my frame rate locking in a solid 120 fps just like before (with no dips whatsoever), my temperatures while gaming were hovering around 39c. Previously, they were around 50c! (As an aside, I am using a Noctua DH\-15 which I purchased yesterday). The reason for the temperature drops? Two\-fold: (1) My BIOS re\-enabled some AMD power saving settings such as c6 state and cpb, and (2) XFR was working its magic. It was giving me exactly what I needed for the task I was doing. All without me having to lift a finger.

**In conclusion:** I realize that tweaking things can be fun. I realize that until now manual overclocking was the way to go. But AMD has made it a relic of the past. You've probably heard this before, and I had to. But now I wholeheartedly see why people are saying this. A manual OC of these chips is not only a waste of your time, but it can actually hurt your performance in some areas. Just let XFR work its magic. It's the only surefire way to get the best of both worlds: Incredibly fast multi\-core speed, and overclocked single core speeds when you need it. So get out of your BIOS, close down Ryzen Master, put away your benchmarking tools, and just let AMD handle it. It's a premium feature of the chip, and disabling it is like buying a ferrari but only staying in 3rd gear.

**TL;DR \-** For best performance, let AMD control all voltages and clock speeds via XFR and stop trying to manually overclock any Ryzen 2xxx series chip."

tl;dr,
I'm thinking of migrating my homelab from a handful of Sandy and Ivy Bridge E3s and Core i5/i7s to a single Ryzen ESXi Windows desktop (GPU passthrough) / FreeBSD VM file server (since Ryzen supports ECC).

I know I could go with Epyc, but I'm more attracted to the Ryzen 1) because I'm cheap and 2) because its single-theaded speed is considerably faster than any Epyc processor I could conceivably afford.

Right now my machines idle around 100w each so I'm consuming up to 400w power just having them sit on, add another 200w or so when they're being utilized - I noticed max power draw at the wall for a x399 w/ 1950x according to Adtech.com was under 400w and idles around 75w, so that'd be a real power savings.

Anyway, I guess the question I'm wanting to ask is:

2) Do you use GPU passthrough (for a desktop type system)? Specifically, which GPUs have you tried, what did you have to do to get it to work?

I got it up and running once at 2666, after which (and in all other attempts) it would boot loop several times and default back to 2133. My BIOS won't let me adjust DRAM voltage above 1.35V, and I'm just really frustrated that I spent money on good RAM and can't get it even NEAR rated. 

How can such a good board do such a bad job OCing? What BIOS versions are y'all running that get you guys closer to rated speed? Please help!

System:

* Ryzen 5 1600 @stock with stock cooler
* ASrock AB350M, **BIOS version 3.20 (updated from 3.00)**
* 16GB G.Skill TridentZ RGB **3000** MHz (PC4 24000), Model F4\-3000C16D\-16GTZR **16\-18\-18\-38**
* EVGA GTX 980Ti SC

Amd,GlorXodor,6,1,"ryzen 7 2700x overclock and temp issue, i need some help :/Im having huge issues with this 2700x i just purchased and could really do with some advice.

My setup is;

MOBO \- crosshair vi hero x370 

CPU \- ryzen 7 2700x 

RAM \- 16GB 3200mhz g.skill flare x 

PSU \- corsair rm850

3x noctua air flow front intake fans

1x noctua static rear exhaust fan

H100i v2 top mounted with 2x noctua static exhaust fans 

Case \- 570x with the front and side glass panel removed

Ambient room temp is 26 degrees

All temp readings are taken using HWiNFO64 5.84\-3450

The problem i am having is as follows;

I purchased a 2700x upgrading from a 1600x, i decided not to upgrade the motherboard for now as it is apparently compatible with the bios update 6101.

Prior to installing the CPU i cleared cmos and load optimized bios settings to start fresh.

I installed the CPU with the H100i v2 all set at stock but the temps were horrid! idling in the 50\-60 degree range and becoming so hot under load when running cinebench r15 that the the pc would shutdown. I repeated the process whilst checking the temps and noticed the CPU temp under load being 85\+degrees causing the system shutdown.

I was concerned my H100i v2 was failing so i removed it and replaced it with the stock cooler than came in the box with the 2700x, the wraith prism.

Now the stock cpu fan was installed, decide to do some idle and load tests and check temps and then OC the CPU and repeat the tests to compare.

My idle temp is 40\-50 degrees, with random peaks of 58 degrees when i click on a window or start menu for example.

Cinebench temp is 70 degrees. If i rerun cinebench instantly again the temp stays around 70\-71 degrees.

When i run a 5 minute test on aida64 testing just the CPU the temp sits comfortably around 62degrees. If i run a FPU test the temp instantly hits 80degrees but does not shutdown although i only ran the test for 30seconds, i do not like to run this test, i did so to see if it would shutdown the pc instantly or not which is what happens when the H100i v2 is on the CPU.

Now i will increase the multiplier to 42 and ram to 3200mhz with everything else in the bios set to default.

My idle temp is 44\-60 degrees.

Cinebench temp is 86, i did not do a 2nd test as the pc would most likely shutdown or freeze.

aida64 CPU stability test temp instantly jumped to 70 degrees and after 5 minutes was bouncing between 75\-76 degrees. FPU test was an instant pc shutdown.

Current idle CPU voltage is 1.456

I will change the voltage to 1.375 in bios and rerun tests to check temp comparison.

Idle temps is 45\-55 degrees.

Cinebench temp is 84.

aida64 CPU stability temp jumps to 65 degrees and after 5 mins was bouncing between 71\-72 degrees. 

FPU test was again an instant pc shutdown.

I will now attach the H100i v2 and reset the bios back to optimized settings to compare temps. 

CPU idle temp is 40\-50 degrees, the same as stock fan temps.

H100i v2 Liquid temp is 34\-35 degrees, ambient temp is 26 degrees.

Cinebench CPU temp is 77 degrees and liquid temp increases to 37 degrees. 7 degree increase from the stock fan temp.

aida64 CPU stability temp jumps to 62 degrees and after 5 mins the CPU temp was 67 degrees and very slowly climbing still, the liquid temp reached 41 degrees. 5 degrees more than the stock fan again.

FPU test reached 84 degrees after 23 seconds so i stopped the test. 

Now i will increase the mutlplier to 42 and ram to 3200mhz again to compare those results with the stock fan.

CPU idle temp is 50\-65 degrees, 5 degrees more than stock fan.

Cinebench CPU temp is 85 and liquid is 43 degreed. Same as stock fan temps.

aida64 CPU stability test caused the CPU temp to reach 91 degrees and freeze the pc after 1\-2mins. 20\+ degrees more than the stock fan did which increased at a much faster rate than the stock fan.

Ive removded the OC for now whilst i look to find a new heatsink for the CPU to test, but i feel that my CPU is running hotter than expected and wanted others opinions who are familiar with the CPU as i am considering sending the CPU back to be replaced.

I wonder if my H100i v2 is not capable of transfering enough heat from the CPU as the temps appear better with the stock cooler that came with the CPU even when testing OC settings which i would have imagines the AIO should have been much better handling the heat but it wasnt. Ive seen a few threads of people complaining that there AIO does not handle the heat of the 2700x niether. In the long run i had considered upgrading to a complete water cooled system, but with how this CPU temps increase so much with an OC i cant see how any water cooled system would cope? I have also tested 4.1ghz and 4ghz and the results are all pretty much similar, also such OC seem pointless when test results are not much more than stock results which is why im feeling dissapointed with this CPU atm. 

What do you think? Dodgy CPU? Dodgy AIO? Dodgy CPU and AIO? The idea of a 4.2ghz OC with this processor comes from the much advertised OC ability of the processor from multiple sources, is this not correct? 

Any advice is much appreciated :D"

Regarding price: 1600 is 150€, 2400G, 1500X 135€ and 1400 120€. I picked the latter because 1500X and 2400G are too close to the 1600 (and I'm using a dGPU). 1400 is 30€ less and can be OCed to match 1500X and 2400G."

For graphics card I'm using two FX 7950 running in crossfire. 

 Originally I posted a reddit thread on windows subreddit because I assumed the issue was faulty windows update (the issue happened shortly after windows update) https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/8lwgnf/screen_tearing_black_screen_of_death_details_in/

And I managed to fix it by reinstalling the drivers. However just yesterday the issue came back (at this point I've seen teal, green, blue and red stripes, yay!) and started to look more into the issue. I managed to corner down the issue to my graphics cards.

It seems that the one card is working properly, PC boots and plays normally with this card properly.

However with the other card it just boots into black screen and I haven't been able to make it work. Fans still spin when I boot PC with the faulty card on.

I'm curious if the card has just died or if it could be an issue with the bios of the card or some other reason why it's acting up weirdly.

At some point I was able to start up PC normally and start a game while having both cards plugged in, but shortly after the PC would just get stuck and screen would be covered with whatever was the color primarily going on screen at the moment. "

I play the game for about 10-15 minutes perfectly fine, then all of a sudden my CPU usage drops from around 40% to all the way to 10%. When this happens, my FPS goes down to around 10, making everything unplayable. 

Here is a video showcasing this:

I cannot figure out what this is. Here is what I have tried/tinkered with already - 

- It is not temps. GPU temps are great with my hybrid card, and my CPU temps are good even with the overclock. According to HWinfo, my VRMs aren't overheating either. They sit at around 50c. 

- It is not my graphics drivers. I have tried latest drivers, and older drivers. No dice. 

- I thought it could be my HDH, but according to crystaldiskinfo, my drives are nice and healthy.

I currently have a RX 580 (msi armor 8gb) and I am planning to upgrade my pc in about half a year.

Amd,kek_mate,50,107,"Extra CPU Bandwidth is beyond fantastic for gaming. ( R7 1700 ).Hey all,

Figured I'd just share a bit of a user experience tale here.  In particular for gaming I hear loads of people still saying ""if you just want to game, go get the i5 over the ryzen for those few extra FPS!"".  That's absolutely true, but I'm here to give a slightly different angle. 

My friend is using a slightly older i5 4c/4t (4xxx) machine that I helped him build ~3 years ago.  With a good OC he can get better frames than I can in a few older games with my 1700 on a mild undervolt and OC to 3.7 ghz.

We've been playing a myriad of games together, and as with many coop style games you need to host a server to play.  Many of you can already see where this is going.  Now when we want to play such games as Rust, 7 days to die, or the behemoth that is ARMA3, I'll host the server.  For some anecdotal numbers here, my mate hosting the server and playing with only 3-4 people on arma had his machine chugging down to 30 fps from what was usually a solid 60.

Yesterday I hosted the ARMA3 server, had 10 people connected, and was playing on it myself at a solid 60 fps ( vysnc on ).  My mate also had 60 fps because he wasn't hosting, and there was ZERO perceptible difference on my end that would have told me I was hosting the server and playing on it; I also queried the people playing with us and none of them had any lag issues.  I was laughing about how easily my machine was accomplishing this to my mate ( task manager showed a few cores utilized and many sitting around doing nothing )and his sentiment was, when he upgrades next, he's going ryzen.

Now more cores isn't exactly exclusive to Ryzen or AMD, but AMD did drop the first bombs to start the CoreWar.(tm) and for that I'm quite grateful.  I'm consistently finding new ways I hadn't really thought of before the purchase to use the extra horsepower at my fingertips.  Tl;dr here, even if you're going to ""only be gaming"", extra cpu bandwidth opens up options that you wouldn't have without moarcoars. "

Just got a Vega 64 with Freesync 2 monitor (Samsung C27HG70). Now when I am in a game, I noticed my secondary monitor is no longer updating live. So for example, if I have a video or something playing, the audio will be playing but the frame will be frozen. If I put the focus off the game, it starts updating properly, bbut once the game takes focus again, the frame freezes up again.

If I play the game in fullscreen mode, the issues seems to go away, but I tend to prefer borderless window for most games.

Ive tried turning off Freesync in Radeon Settings, as well as disabling FRTC, no effect. Tried changing the second monitor from DP to HDMI to DVI, no change. Did a clean install of the driver using the clean install option in the driver setup.

Previous card was a RX480, didnt have any issue like this.

Amd,AlphaInit,31,0,"Petition - Ban cheaters based on HardwareIDHello AMD,

I'd love to see you work with game developers to create a global ban list for confirmed cheaters, based on HardwareID/physical hardware.

Right now, cheaters use stolen Creditcards to get dirt-cheap copies of games, so when their game account is banned they can keep cheating for another $5. This encourages creditcard fraud/theft.

If you install cheats and are 100% confirmed to be running cheats in an online game, there needs to be a global ban put on that physical machine, that will prevent it from ever joining any online game that participates in the ban list.

Used hardware sold on ebay could get unbanned with proof of purchace and government issued ID. Anyone who purchaces cheat-banned hardware, gets it unbanned, and then cheats on that hardware, would be put on another blacklist and not be allowed to have cheater hardware unbanned ever again.

To anyone who says this is unfair, it isnt. You're not required to buy any games that support this anticheat feature. And the rest of us are sick of your cheats.

Im currently an nVidia user, but i would gladly switch to AMD if you were to do something like this. I know at the end of the day, its going to require participation from nvidia and intel as well, but whoever gets the ball rolling on this will gain many loyal customers. We're absolutely tired of cheaters."

I sent XFX an email explaining my situation, expecting pretty much nothing, *maybe* some troubleshooting tips I haven't tried before but all they did was confirm if I tried everything possible and I explained that I did. From driver updates, to clean Windows install, to new BIOS, even to trying the card in a new build. Pretty much explained the card was *dead*, and detailed all the steps I took trying to bring it back to life.  

They asked if I could find the Newegg invoice, which I did, and as soon as I sent it over *they approved me for a RMA*. Granted this is a 5 year old card so I doubt they have any in stock, I was thinking they possibly had a way to repair it. Instead they sent me out a R9 270X Double D which seems to be the equivalent to my old 7870, and all I had to do was pay $10 shipping to get my card to them.

Amd,Ceremony64,39,10,"Tightly timed Hynix with a pinch of BCLK OCAfter 7 years of i7\-2600K Quadcoregoodness, I more than doubled my performance and efficiency with Octacoreawesomeness:

* AMD Ryzen 7 2700X
* GigaByte X470 Aorus Gaming 7
* G.Skill SniperX 32GB \(2x16GB\) DDR4\-3600 CL19\-19\-19\-39\-58 Kit \(e.g. F4\-3600C19D\-32GSXW\)
* \(and a few extras, like a NVMe\)

Unfortunately, my initial experience wasn't that great: A laggy system that froze for a few seconds from time to time \(I think the AMD RAID driver was to blame for this\) and overall it just didn't run that stable \(with stock RAM and clocks!\). After a new install \(w/o RAID\) and a switch to the Gaming 7 \(returned the X470 Taichi with it's buggy BIOS\), the system was at finally responsive and I could focus on tuning the system.

My biggest hurdle was the RAM: Largely untested in a Ryzen build \(at least, I didn't find much about it on the interwebs\), featuring SK Hynix C\-die \(H5AN8G8NCFR\-TFC\) in a dual rank  configuration. The XMP profile refused to POST and the suggested Safe profiles of the Ryzen DRAM Calculator @ 3200\+MHz were not stable/bootable either. So I spent the better part of weekend, tweaking and tinkering till I achieved the tightest stable clocks my system could muster. At least I think they are:

**3370MHz CL18\-18\-18\-36\-54 with tight subtimings @ 1.44V based on a 101.11MHz Baseclock \(\+ Precision Boost Overdrive enabled\).**

Well, it certainly isn't as tight as the ass of some sweet Samsung B\-Die, but I hope the system won't be bottlenecked/slowed down by it too much.

My BCLK OC is pretty minor, as the NVMe and SATA drives bottlenecked my potential: I hit a wall at around 101.25MHz \(with all drives still recognized\), so I settled for a little less for improved stability. I could hit a higher BCLK OC with fewer SATA drives hooked up, but that just isn't a price I'm willing to pay.

Anyway, here are a few CPU/RAM focused benchmarks of mine:

[AIDA64 Cache &amp; Memory Benchmark](https://i.redd.it/fxwyexufnwx01.png)

[Cinebench 1862 MT \/ 182 SC](https://i.redd.it/x2zjw5wjnwx01.png)

Unfortunately, I couldn't find comparable scores of a 2700X system at around 3333\-3400MHz with better RAM \(B\-die, tighter timings, etc.\), so I'm not sure how my system compares. What numbers is your Ryzen System getting?

Is there any consensus on which DDR4 memory provides the best performance vs. cost with the new generation Ryzens?  I'm not sure what I should be focusing on with respect to ideal MHz and CL ratings.  If I can narrow down a short list it will make checking for compatibility easier to do.

The PC is going to be used as more of a general system.  Some gaming, some video editing, but nothing that's super intense or demanding for excessive periods of time.  Despite the current prices I'm leaning towards 16gb as 8gb seems to anemic.

Amd,jortego128,248,268,"We should Be Careful Judging Ryzen 2 Based on El Chapuza's reviews...So the 2700X looked good in that review...almost ***too*** good IMO.  Copy and paste sites like WCCFTECH now have headlines stating 2700X is a better gaming chip than 8700k.  I think we should  be cautious/wait before we go around the world declaring that the 2700x beats 8700k in gaming workloads, and heres why:

&amp;nbsp;

1.\) These tests were conducted at 1080p and 4K ***Ultra*** settings using a GTX 1070.  This is def a non\-standard test setup for measuring CPU performance and looking at the tests objectively, one cannot deny there is a serious GPU bottleneck occuring in the 4K tests and I believe it even begins to creep in for some of the 1080p benches.   This is evidenced by the 6700k beating the 8700k in more benches than not and even an R5 1400 beating both the 8700k and 2700X in one test, which is highly suspect.

&amp;nbsp;

2.\)The Timespy score is another bench that is clearly GPU limited.   While the 2700X wins there, it looses by a 500 point margin in the non\-ultra Firestrike test.

&amp;nbsp;

3.\)Curiously, the Cinebench ST score was omitted\-\- why?  I dont think even the most hard\-core fanboi believes the 2700X would top the 8700k there, but why not include it so we can at least see what difference the new mobo setup made?

&amp;nbsp;

4.\)There are several typos and some very hard to believe claims made in the review, the foremost being that the 2700X/x470 setup consumed 40W less power than a similar 1700x/x370 setup.  Of all the tests done in the review, I find this to be most suspect.  A 1700X has a TDP of 95W.  A 40W savings  is equivalent to a 42&amp;#37; more power efficient processor, and this occurs while having a \&gt;10&amp;#37; clock speed increase.  Im sorry, but Im not buying it\-\- if its true, it must come from something other than the processor, yet what it is and why, we have no clue.   If you recall, the CanardPC review said the total system power consumption was *more* than the 1700X.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, some say that this is an error in translation, that what they meant was that the platform consumed 40W more than the 1700X platform.  This is believeable, but almost seems to err almost too much on the ""not good"" side, considering the 2700X TDP is only 10W more than 1700X.  However, at the bottom of the review, the power consumption is listed on the ""\+"" category, and Google translate shows the statement as below.

https://i.redd.it/9peygs2xivr01.png

&amp;nbsp;

Given that GloFo themselves have stated the new 12nm process  yields a 10&amp;#37; efficiency improvement, this makes no sense.  So which is it???

&amp;nbsp;

Also, it must be noted that the 8700k was equipped with 3600Mhz memory while the 2700X was equipped with only 3200MHz memory.  This seems to indicate that the 2700X was actually at a slight disadvantage in these tests and may improve with faster memory.

To conclude, I  think we should wait for proper reviews post\-NDA date before making final judgement."

Currently just running distributed computing on it, but in a few paychecks it might be a living room gaming system.

I had a hiatus from my computer and after about a week I jumped into an OW comp game and my computer crashes 20 seconds after loading.  My Vega refuses to power on at all anymore and I've deduced that it is indeed the issue.  I broke the warranty seal so I could put a water block on it never thinking that I would need to send it in after having stress tested it before.

According to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/8bl86f/warranty_void_stickers_are_illegal/) it is illegal to have warranty void stickers.  How would I go about sending my card into Gigabyte?  Should I explicitly call them out and tell them it's illegal to NOT warrant my graphics card?

Amd,darkcurse,21,5,"HEVC transcoding with overclocks**Background:** I've got a 1600X which I'm currently running stock along with RAM with 3200MT with tuned timings/subtimings. The system is performing really well for now and probably the heaviest (CPU wise) thing that I do with it is video transcoding (h.264 -&gt; HEVC). After switching motherboards (Asus C6H -&gt; MSI X370 Gaming M7 ACK) I've managed to drop my core voltage from 1.381V to 1.35V with LLC mode 3 for a 4.0GHz overclock.

**Question:** With my video transcoding I'm finding that I don't gain much performance. Videos transcode at about 11fps using the H.265 MKV 1080p30 preset in Handbrake v1.0.7 x64 which defaults to CRF: 20 and Slow. However my temps jump from &lt;60C to ~75C and that's not really worth it to me. Benchmarks show an increase in performance but its not really reflected in my actual use-case. Is there something I'm doing wrong here?

**tl;dr:** H.265 encode stock vs overclock = same performance but much higher temps

**edit:** made the overclock a bit more clearer"

Amd,BadReIigion,87,134,"@AMD Whats the issue regarding Raven Ridge Drivers? Why isn't it part of the regular Radeon Software ""Adrenalin"" Suite?So I ve tested hundreds of applications on Raven Ridge and I am not happy (specially mobile).

E.g: The HP Envy x360 (Ryzen 5 2500U) is out now for more than 4 months and no (official) driver update has been made available. The current drivers are buggy and unstable. So buyers that wanted a notebook that allows for casual gaming (a selling point of Raven Ridge) got screwed basically, similiar situation for 2700U notebooks.

The situation for 2400G/2200G is better, since the launch driver is fairly new. But there is no way to determine what optimizations the driver includes or not (and will they get more updates regularly?). Not to forget that you miss out all ""Adrenalin"" features.

For the last few years **ALL** APU's (Bristol Ridge, Stoney Ridge, Kaveri, Kabini ect) including their mobile versions got driver updates from AMD through their WHQL releases and still do.

It was **the big plus** to know, that when you buy a Notebook with an AMD APU you will get proper driver support for games (not only) compared to Intel e.g (and even they have frequent releases now and upped their game).

With most advantages gone, that would potentially come with an AMD GPU inside, why should anyone buy a Raven Ridge Notebook at this point?

Specially now, when GPU's are rare and many tend to buy an APU as a temporary solutions the current driver situation seems odd.

In the past you've got weak Bristol Ridge Laptop's with great up-to-date drivers. Now you get powerful Raven Ridge Laptop's with old &amp; relatively bad drivers. Cant be.


**Edit**
Would love people would stop searching excuses and focus on being a paying consumer. Dont get me wrong, I want them to do well, but why launch a product this way (specially mobile)
 
**Basically I would just like to know (from AMD), what a buyer of 2400G/2200G and 2700U/2500U/2300U can expect regarding driver support (I dont care why). Should not be that hard to answer. Its just important to know as a consumer**

Amd,Catsandradiobats,49,12,"PC for Dota 2 and World of Warcraft around 750 bucksHello,

my friends laptop crapped out and he would like to build a pc to play these games. The budget sucks, but I may be able to convince him to wait for another paycheck and go higher. Anyway...

**His philosophy:**

 - CPU: 2400G (initially R3 1200 + Rx560)
 - RAM: some shit 8GB single stick
 - MOBO: the cheapest possible
 - PSU: the cheapest possible



**My philosophy:**

 - CPU: 2400G, actually maybe even 2200G (2200g seems to handle those games)
 - RAM: at least dual channel, G.SKILL 8GB KIT DDR4 3200MHz CL16 RipjawsV  should be good enough right?
 - MOBO: high-end (something like Aorus Gaming K7, but with new X470 chipset)
 - PSU: high-end (Evga Supernova G3 550)

**His reasoning is obvious-** He would like to be able to play those games (right now) and spend as little as possible. 

**My reasoning:**

Buy **expensive PSU**. A PSU that will be awesome even in his next system and **allows for comfortable overclocking**. In regards to quality, it might be overkill, but doing several months long research before deciding to buy this very PSU myself I don't think he will be overpaying much. 


**The motherboard** - in the future (2+years) I would like him to be able to **slap some 7nm+ Ryzen into the board, overclock** the shit out of it (while having all the tools to OC the 2400G right now) and rock it for the next few years. With that obviously comes the need to buy dedicated GPU, but I believe that this approach is better than to build whole another pc again.

If the 2400G (or 2200G) is powerful enough to play those games comfortably (he doesn't care about graphical details), what would you suggest?

**And what kind of memory would you recommend?**

 Ryzens love proper rams (the APU's likely even more), but buying some FlareX 3200 CL14 is not going to happen at this time:D. The Ram situation is just stupid, so I don't know whether to go for the cheapest dimms (dual channel at the very least) and don't regret swapping them for better ones in the future (those mentioned 2 years or so), or buy the best ones possible and just see how they're doing in the future.

**2x4GB 3200 CL16 good enough?** They seem quite cheap and in the future he can buy another set of these. They aren't B-die, but 3200 CL16 isn't actually bad, right?

Anyway,

Thank you very much"

Sorry it's not a very glamorous photo. Btw, the LEDs are RGB and they cycle. I just happened to take a pic when it was white (looks blue on camera). 

The CPU cooler is not as close to the GPU as it looks. I used to have it on top, but the fan vibrates and rattles the cooler when placed there.

I do a bit of Blender (learning), gaming, and schoolwork. Something that people don't realize about Ryzen while gaming is how stable it is. While playing Rainbow 6 Siege, the FPS never spikes down. Although my older i5-7600K (which can OC to 5GHz) can reach a slightly higher FPS, it also spiked down and stuttered. Same story for Battlefield 1. 

In the future I plan on getting a FreeSync monitor. I've used Gsync on a friend's laptop and it was incredible, but Gsync monitors are insanely pricey. One would cost more than half of my PC build! Meanwhile, a FreeSync IPS 1440p 144hz monitor is $360.

So I my thought initially, was that the reason was because AMD thought the performance upgrade from 1800x to the new top CPU (aka 2700X) was to small to retain it's ranking as a *800X CPU. Thus was demoted to the next ranking of *700X, previously held by 1700X.


Something similar to how the r7 370 wasn't an r9.


Then I took a better look of this picture https://cdn.videocardz.com/1/2018/03/AMD-Ryzen-2000-Precios.jpg

As for the thought about the 2800x being the next higher ultimate CPU, I'm not so sure about it since 2700x is at 125 TDP already?

Amd,eat_those_lemons,52,39,"*Tin Foil Hat* What is with the change to it being just stock manipulation as the only culprit for the AmdFlaws fiasco?I am wondering what is up with the sudden change in everyone saying it is now stock manipulation. I know about the Viceroy hit piece and that it was launched 3 hours after the Flaws were announced, but that doesn't rule out that stock manipulation is a smokescreen.

Now I understand this is a **VERY** tinfoil hat thing to say but could it not be Intel? Or another competitor? ( don't know who but don't want to cross anything off yet)

The thing that makes me wonder if it is potentially Intel is the fact that during this interview when discussing their customers they abruptly cut off the call: https://www.adtech.com/show/12536/our-interesting-call-with-cts-labs

And just a side if stock manipulation was the only goal, then why not try to short both AMD and ASMedia? And if their is a vulerability in ALL mobo's (or almost all) then that would seem to be a bigger issue than just being a flaw in what is single digit market share.

If the goal was to short stock then the better method would be to reveal the flaws either as a problem with all mobo's and/or problems with AMD.

Instead they are focusing on AMD which doesn't benifit them as much as it does Intel.

Overall it can't be denied that the biggest winners out of this fiasco are Intel"

I'm using ECC RAM in my Pentium system (DDR4 2133, CL15, 1Rx8, Unbuffered) and definitely want to keep using ECC, but I remember that it was hit and miss for Board support.

So wondering: Does Raven Ridge support ECC? And is there a recommendation for a Micro-ATX board for it? (Don't care about the chipset, A320 or B350 are perfectly fine, but I'll take X370 if it works). Don't care about overclocking and the like, though cTDP support would be awesome."

Amd,GaianNeuron,43,13,"Is Biostar's X370GT7 really the only Ryzen APU-compatible motherboard that supports UHD output? Where are the mATX/mITX options?The 2200G and 2400G look to be *spectacular* workhorses for HTPCs. The onboard Vega graphics are more than sufficient for decoding Ultra-HD video, but sadly, almost all of the offerings on the market can't actually output it. UHD is defined as 4K video at 10 bits per channel, at 60Hz. This requires the use of either [HDMI 2.0+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI#Version_comparison), or [DisplayPort 1.3+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DisplayPort#Technical_specifications).

I'm really miffed that the only motherboard I can find which advertises either of these specs is [Biostar's X370GT7](http://www.biostar-usa.com/app/en-us/mb/introduction.php?S_ID=874#specification). While the $180 price tag on that board isn't ideal, my biggest beef is the utter lack of a mini-ITX (or even micro-ATX) offering. What this means for UHD HTPC builders right now, is that the only ways to make use of a Ryzen APU are:

- Build the HTPC in a full-ATX case (done this once for a HTPC which I left behind when I moved; it worked fine but holy shit it is huge)
- Build a custom case that encloses just the motherboard, PSU, CPU and drives (I have the skill for this, but not the time)
- Add a dGPU with HDMI 2.0+ or DP 1.3+ output, at which point I might as well get a 1400 or 1500X (and then have to spend more on the dGPU anyway)

I've been holding out on building a media PC for months, knowing that the Ryzen APUs would be the ideal foundation for such a machine. Now, I find that if I want to go ahead with the plan on release, I'll either have to use an enormous case (and pay for a ton of motherboard features I don't need), or just buy a discrete GPU anyway.

Have any motherboard manufacturers announced plans for UHD-grade onboard video in a mini-ITX or micro-ATX form factor?"

Because I've yet to find a single retailer here in Sweden that even includes APU anywhere near these new Ryzen ""APUs""? Is this naming only designated by fans and the part of the market that have prior knowledge about how AMD splits their CPU lineups? 


Furthermore, and onto the most important discussion with GPU pricing being off to hell. Why isn't anyone talking about FreeSync when doing these benchmarks? When I see these new APUs struggling to go above 40 in certain titles, and in other games, reach 60 but dip below 40, all I can think of is **adaptive sync**, something both AMD and Nvidia is using. And I'm assuming these new Ryzen APU do support it, but why isn't it talked about? You can find really cheap, sub $200 24inch 1080p monitors with PLS/VA even IPS panels with FreeSync at 60 to 75Hz, so why isn't this being included when we're taking the great value of these low-end products into consideration? 


To me, the idea of getting a APU(CPU+GPU) + Memory + motherboard + SSD + PSU + case + mechanical keyboard + mouse + FreeSync IPS monitor for less than $700 insane in today's PC-economy! So it made me wonder, do these APUs suppprt FreeSync or no? "

In the past [computerbase.de tested this on the A10-7850K APU](https://www.computerbase.de/2014-01/amd-kaveri-arbeitsspeicher/) and found a 7% average increase in FPS with 2 DR DIMMs over 2 SR DIMMs.  
They seem to be one of the few tech reviewers who seem to know what they're doing. I'd imagine they'll cover this at some point again, but their current 2400G covered is not very thorough.  
This test didn't compare 1DR to 2SR, though. 

This is a big deal, because a, say, 7% increase in 2400G FPS puts it significantly closer to RX550 performance.

Then if you look further, you might find some more dual rank vs single rank tests and see that 1 DR DIMM often performs almost as well as 2 SR DIMMs on average, though it can vary a ton in certain games, well above that of 1 SR DIMM especially in minimums. While dual rank is not the same as dual channel, [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_rank) lists these benefits of dual rank: 

* Multi-rank modules allow several open pages in each rank (typically 8 pages per rank). This increases the possibility of getting a hit on an already open row address. The performance gain that can be achieved is highly dependent on the application and the memory controller's ability to take advantage of open pages.

* Subject to some limitations, ranks can be accessed independently, although not simultaneously as the data lines are still shared between ranks on a channel. For example, the controller can send write data to one rank while it awaits read data previously selected from another rank.

I've seemed to notice that AMD CPUs seem to like dual rank memory even more than Intel CPUs, as well, though I don't have those comparisons on hand. [A few small Youtuber's have tested Ryzen to find that, yes, it loves DR DIMMs like its predecessors.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtVRs_Q1ngQ). There are some outliers where DR gives no benefit, and some outliers where 1 DR is better than 2 SR like in Prey, and I'm not sure how many runs this person ran so those could be random, but on average I've generally seen that 1 DR = ~90% the difference between 1 SR and 2 SR.  
Here it's a small difference, but for an APU it tends to be much larger.

And now that the 2400G is out? Not only has no one tested how much DR memory improves performance compared to SR, **none of them even mention whether they used SR or DR memory in their tests**.  
DR DDR4 memory is a heck of a lot rarer than DR DDR3 was, but it does exist.

Also, there's a lot of misinformation going around in every thread here with people saying you **must** get 2 DIMMs.  Well, that's almost certainly not true, though we have no tests to say either way. We only have tests testing 1 SR vs 2 SR, which no duh the 2SR is clearly better. But there's not tests with 2 DR, let alone 1.  
On a budget if you want to later upgrade to 16GB of RAM, you can *likely* go with 1 8GB DR DIMM so you can later expand it to both more memory and more performance with a second later, while having give-or-take the same performance as 2x4GB SR in the mean time.

**edit:** It's also worth pointing out that in previous generations of APUs, using 1 DIMM literally disabled half of the CUS were disabled with single channel, iirc. That's why people say never to single channel with an APU.  
With Raven Ridge, they changed that.  Dual channel on it seems to increase 1% minimums by around 25%. But this is going off a single game test.. While with an a12-9800 going from single channel to dual channel literally doubled your FPS.  So 2 SR is definitely going to be better than 1 DR, but 1 DR does close some of that gap compared to 1 SR in a way that's unknown until tested."

* a million tabs open in firefox.


For now I game usually on my ps4. One of the games I really would like to play on my pc would be rainbow six siege. I saw some reviews that if you put everything on low that you can get 60 fps which is amazing.

The prices haven't changed ($999 for Vega FE, $999 for Vega 56, $1199 for Vega 64 - for the most part).  The 580s are still priced wacky and haven't come down much.


So either the mining market rebounds soon and they sell out - OR - the mining market stays down and eventually prices will drop if newegg is in fact accumulating inventory.  With Volta on the way, AMD GPU prices may be about to take a dip (just as they did at the 1070ti) so holding onto inventory is getting slightly riskier.


Personally, I figure the cards won't decrease in price (even if the market stays down) for at least another two weeks - I doubt newegg has *that* many cards laying around to risk getting nervous about.  They'll likely only drop slightly till Volta, but when Volta launches I can see prices falling in line based on how well Volta vs Vega proportionately mines."
Amd,encrypted11,56,115,"[meta] [raven ridge] The Stilt: Some of my personal thoughts and experiences on Raven&lt;quote;The Stilt&gt;Some of my personal thoughts and experiences on Raven:

Based on the results of my test suite, the IPC of Raven varies between -4.8% - +2.8% compared to Zeppelin. The average difference being ~1.5% improvement. The difference is most likely a result of the changes made to the L2 &amp; L3 caches, rather than the changes made to the actual Zen CPU cores themselves.

The early rumors were correct and Raven does in fact have a significantly lower L2 cache latency than Zeppelin does. The L2 cache in Raven has 12 CLK latency, whereas the L2 latency for Zeppelin is 17 CLKs. The L2 caches in Zeppelin never posed a limitation of any sort to the Fmax, so considering the halved L3 cache in Raven, getting rid of the “slack” in the L2 latency was a smart and most likely a highly beneficial move.

It is hard to tell exactly how small or large the penalty from the halved L3 cache is, as the L2 has been altered significantly at the same time. Generally, however the performance hit from the halved L3 cache varies between small and non-existent. Workloads which hit the &gt; L1 caches hard, such as Bullet Physics library perform &lt; 5% worse on Raven than on Zeppelin, which is equipped with twice the L3 cache per core. Considering that Bullet was relatively the worst performing workload in the whole test suite for Raven, it is rather safe to say that the hit from the smaller L3 cache is extremely minor in general.

The difference between the Vega 8 (8CU/2RB) iGPU and Vega 11 (11CU/2RB) iGPU at the same frequency is extremely minor, usually around 8-11% depending on the memory frequency. At stock Vega 8 operates at 1100MHz engine clock and Vega 11 at 1240MHz (1251MHz nominal) engine clock. The typical overclock for both of the variants is &gt;= 1600MHz at 1.200V SoC voltage. Due to the present memory bandwidth limitation, both of them will perform almost the same when they are overclocked close or to the typical maximum frequency.

One major thing to consider prior overclocking the iGPU on Raven APUs is the power consumption. Most of the mainstream AM4 motherboards have a 2 phase VRM for the VDDCR_SoC voltage rail (in varying quality and with varying cooling as well), which on Raven not only supplies the SoC portion of the chip but the GPU cores as well. At stock the peak power consumption of Vega 11 is around 36W. When overclocked to the typical 1600MHz engine frequency, the power consumption will raise to 55-60W. While 60W doesn't sound too high, it is more than plenty for the average 2 phase VRM (around 25A per phase).

Just like Zeppelin, Raven also features the so called ""OC-Mode"". On Raven there are two separate triggers to activate the “OC-Mode”: by increasing the CPU frequency or by increasing the iGPU engine frequency. Triggering either one will get rid all of the limiters (power, current, utilization) and voltage controllers, the same way as it did on Zeppelin. The only difference is that by triggering just iGPU “OC-Mode”, the Turbo / XFR features of the CPU will not be lost like they were on Zeppelin. However at least for the time being, it is not advised to only trigger the iGPU “OC-Mode”: Activating either of the “OC-Modes” will disable all of the voltage controllers, meaning that when the Turbo / XFR will still remain active the CPU voltage will raise to extremely high levels. When the CPU “OC-Mode” is activated Turbo and XFR will be disabled as well, just like on Zeppelin and the CPU voltage will remain at reasonably sane levels due to the slightly lower resulting frequencies.

Activating either of the “OC-Modes” will also immediately disable the dLDO for the GPU cores. At stock the iGPU dLDO feeds on the VDDCR_SoC voltage rail and the typical voltage drop on the regulator is around 250mV. Once the “OC-Mode” is activated the GPU dLDO is placed in a bypass mode, meaning the GPU cores will then receive the source voltage directly without any further dropouts.

The memory controller on Raven clearly contains some changes in comparison to Zeppelin, however the said changes unfortunately appear to be rather minor and quite possibly affect more the firmwares of the controller than the actual hardware IP itself. On average the memory latency has decreased by ~3% at the same settings, but the bandwidth seems to have regressed slightly at the same time. Also, the highest achievable memory frequency seems to be exactly the same as on Zeppelin, 3400 - 3533MHz depending on the silicon quality, the motherboard and the DRAM modules used. Fortunately, at least the memory training speed and reliability has been vastly improved.

Similar to Zeppelin, the frequency headroom for the CPU cores themselves is very slim over the stock frequencies. The typical, highest practical CPU frequency will be around 3.85 - 3.95GHz depending on the silicon quality.

https://i.imgur.com/0qXOU7x.png

Higher than the mentioned frequencies might be possible, however achieving them will require the voltage to be raised to a point where the power efficiency is long gone and the life time of the silicon is reduced. At frequencies beyond the inflation point (3.9GHz in the chart) the cost of the last 100MHz in frequency can easily be &gt; 25% increase in the power consumption.

With the tested samples 4.1GHz could not be achieved even at 1.550V despite 4.0GHz was deemed stable at 1.375V, which is already high but still well in the realms of sustainable.

With Raven there is also another aspect, which is not present on Zeppelin: Unlike Zeppelin, Raven uses conventional TIM (instead of indium sTIM) between the core and the heatspreader. The conventional TIM used on Raven isn’t the only factor which affects it’s thermals either. Due to the extreme thinness of the Raven die, the heatspreader used for Raven AM4 APUs has been redesigned. Normally the contact surface inside the heatspeader is perfectly flat. The heatspreaders used on Raven have a “hump” inside them, which allows the heatspreader to make contact with the die itself. Without the “hump” the heatspreader would only make contact with the SMD components located around the die, which are standing taller than the die itself. The “hump” adds an extra 0.5mm to the heatspreader thickness and therefore increases the thermal resistance of the heatspreader as well.

Despite the Raven's slightly larger die size, the temperatures are still significantly higher at the same power dissipation and cooling. Even at a modest 65W power dissipation the CPU cores can reach excess of 70°C temperatures.

An aftermarket cooler is definitely recommended at least for the 2400G, especially if there is any plans to overclock the chip. 2400G at the stock configuration is already somewhat bound by the default 65W power limit and the chip can easily dissipate up to 120W of heat when it is overclocked to the typical maximum figures.

https://i.imgur.com/dMwRtn9.jpg

Some ballpark 3D performance figures, based on my own testing: RX 550 is around 22% faster and the RX 560 around 68% faster than a stock 2400G APU.
When the 2400G APU is overclocked to the typical maximum figures (1600MHz engine and 3400MHz DRAM) it’s performance is almost identical to a stock RX 550.

- 2400G at stock: 1240MHz engine, 2933MHz DRAM (3236 in 3DMark Fire Strike)
- 2400G at a typical max OC: 1600MHz engine, 3400MHz DRAM (3960 in 3DMark Fire Strike)
- RX 550 at stock: 1210MHz engine, 7000MHz (QDR) DRAM (3955 in 3DMark Fire Strike)
- RX 560 at stock: 1210MHz engine, 7000MHz (QDR) DRAM (5430 in 3DMark Fire Strike)

If you are unfamiliar with some of the terms used, please check the original Ryzen: Strictly Technical write-up.

''EDIT 02/12/2017'': Regarding the results when delidded, I reassembled the delidded 2400G using Liquid Ultra on both of the surfaces (die and the HS ""hump""). The temperatures dropped by 12°C (at 4.0GHz / 1.375V) during Prime95 compared to the stock situation. On the same exact cooler and at the same exact settings. The ambient was most likely 1-2°C higher than it was during the previous test too.

However, despite the lower temperatures there was no improvement in Fmax. 4.0GHz / 1.375V is still the highest stable frequency. &lt;/quote&gt;

MSI B350 Mortar for Raven Ridge?
u/Doebringer
I posted the other day with a question regarding a CPU cooler for a new home PC.

I'm building a compact build that was originally going to be mini-itx, but since that time I've kinda settled on a case that can also fit micro ATX boards, which expands my mobo options.

I was originally going to go with an ASUS ROG Strix b350-i, but I'm looking now at the MSI B350 mortar. It's one of the micro Atx boards that actually has a heatsink for the CPU vrms.

My concern is two-fold:

1) Only 2 vrm phases for the SoC (which also powers the GPU cores of the APU)

2) No heatsinks on the SoC Vrms.

now, I can cheaply buy some little heatsinks for the SoC mosfets, and I'm planning on using a top-down cooler, so they'll get plenty of airflow. I'm not too worried about temps.

My concern is the the SoC voltage and current that the GPU cores require - is it too much for the 2 phases? I know that the Asus I was considering has a similar total number of phases for CPU and SoC, but they're likely higher quality.

Anyone with expertise willing to chime in?

My priorities are, in order:

1) OC RAM to at least 3200, 3466 or 3600 if possible 2) Get CPU cores to 4 ghz if possible. 3.9 otherwise (I'd like to do this with p-state overclocking if I can, to maintain power saving features when idle/low stress) 3) Mild OC of GPU cores. Base is 1250, I'll probably shoot for around 1400mhz, though all the reviews that OC seem to hit 1550 or so without a problem.

The goal of this PC is a family PC for kids/wife. Will do light gaming (mostly esports, occasional World of Warcraft) and other regular tasks like streaming video, internet browsing, homework (including office stuff and occasional light photo/video editing), etc.

Suggestions welcome."

Hi, just trying to help others with AMD cards because i believe i found a temporary solution to Windows 10 users who have stuttering on latest Relive drivers. I seemed to not have it on 1607 build of Windows 10 (Anniversary Update) but as soon as i installed Fall Creators Update from Microsoft's site, even with autoupdates disabled, i had a load of stuttering. It was unsolvable on that build, the problem was to do with the latest public build of Windows 10 and it's been solved in the pre-release, non public (yet) 17025 build, or at least reduced that games do not encounter stuttering.

The OS still has a small mouse 'stop' while logging in. But then everything is smooth, OpenGL games (ProjectX/Forsaken, Doom), DirectX9 games (CS:Go tested with very high as well as all low, no MSAA, and cl_forcepreload ""0"") and Vulkan (Doom).
Any stuttering comes now only from the card itself and probably within margin of error for Relive drivers. The Relive interface also 'snaps' into place faster, and feels non stuttery when moving around.

***This has been tested on a:***

* *CPU*: AMD Ryzen 5 1600 OC @ 3,85GHz @ 1,35V 6C
* *GPU*: Sapphire NITRO+ RX 470 OC+ 4GB GDDR5 Radeon card.

* *RAM*: G.SKILL TridentZ Series F4-3600C17D-16GTZ CL17 3600 @ 3466MHz CL16.. custom timings.
* *SD1*: Crucial_CT525MX300SSD1 500GB SATA3 SSD for OS
* *SD2*: Seagate Barracuda 2TB 7200RPM HDD (2017 version)
* *PSU*: Be Quiet! 700W 80+ Silver Modular Pure Power 10 BN279
* *LCD*: AOC G2460PF 1920x1080 144Hz Freesync Displayport 1.2 Monitor

* **Driver*: Radeon ReLive Adrenalin Alpha 18.1.1 x64 Win10.
* **Tested with**: Frametime graph on MSI Afterburner 4.4.2 (less jumpy, similar to 1607) and real-world perceived differences.

***How i found this?***

I found [this post on nvidia forums](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/1004600/geforce-drivers/all-games-stuttering-with-fps-drops-since-windows-10-creators-update/176/) as this problem seems to affect all dedicated GPUs , NVIDIA as well as AMD. On default  Fall Creators Update Microsoft ('they') changed the scheduler and exclusive fullscreen has been almost purged. This means the DWM is affecting games in a strange way and most 3D accelerated programs resulting in stuttering. I noticed with disabled privacy settings, diagtrack service off and this build, i have no more stutter except where is AMD card's performance in OpenGL Doom and only at the start, then it goes away. I only disabled basic OOBE privacy settings all of them unticked, all Windows services are operating as default and no stuttering.

***In short***:

Avoid 1709 public release and use the Insider preview build.
Use your Windows 10 key/previous activated motherboard and a sign-in to Microsoft account and become an Insider on a Win10 PC. Then download the ISO, it will say ""Windows10_InsiderPreview_x64_**XX**-*XX**_17025.iso"" where **XX** = *language* (e.g. - ""Windows10_InsiderPreview_x64_pl-pl_17025.iso"" for Polish). Install clean if possible to assure stability.

***Result:***

System feels a lot more responsive in games.

A few bugs i encountered are:

- No 'tickboxes' on installaters and different programs to select stuff (they are invisible but still there and i have to keyboard them in and see them 'blink' to know i picked 'run MSI afterburner' off, etcetra.

- **NOT IMPORTANT:**  One old 2004 InstallShield installer of a game failed to create a desktop shortcut; all other applications install shortcuts just fine.

- The account Insider preview page says itself it's broken with updating, and i failed to install the function updates of *17025.1000 (rs_prerelease) (2)* However i am still able to receive, find and install updates for Microsoft products.

- I also use this program called ['EmptyStandbyList.exe'](https://wj32.org/wp/software/empty-standby-list/) which i run as a service to run at system startup in Task Scheduler, with SYSTEM instead of my user and the highest privileges settings with no auto-stop. It apparently clears something related to RAM which can get rid of the bloat for a while with stuttering. Use this only if you experience stuttering still.

Hope this helps.

So I built this [PC](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/7mpgut/my_graduation_gift_to_myself_first_build_in/) a few months back and I've had issues getting my RGB to work. I've updated to the latest version of Aura and updated the BIOS, but nothing. My ASUS mobo (crosshair VI hero) isn't even detected by Aura, only my graphics card (Strix 1080). So I'm left with rainbow RGB Ram (G.Skill Trident Z RGB) and rainbow mobo lights. My NZXT CPU cooler (Kraken x52) is also stuck on the default white. I couldn't even get their CAM software to detect the controller. So I'm at a loss. I've been in contact with their customer support and it seems like they don't really know what to tell people either because I got what seems like a copy+paste email telling me to install some Intel drivers to fix my issue. I'm not the most tech savvy, but that doesn't seem right. Supposedly to detect the RAM you need to enable SPD writing, but I cannot find that option in my BIOS.

I know this is an issue for a lot of people, but I'm reaching out everywhere in hopes that I can finally 'complete' my build and have control over my lights...which is half the reason I bought all the components that I did."

Amd,CHRIS-plat,14,1,"Question: Why do Cryptonight miners who use Vega ask for the Compute Switch.I began mining Ethereum with my RX480 on June 2017 and my Hash 
Rate was at 27.3Mh but when there was a new DAG file increase the hashrate slightly decreased. This was an issue for the Polaris cards when mining ETH or ETC. By August my hashrate dropped to approx 24Mh (from what I remember).

As a solution AMD integrated the Compute Switch which would fix the ever decreasing hashrate for ETH/ETC miners whenever the DAG file increased.

What I would like to understand is why Cryptonight miners (mostly Monero miners) are asking for the compute switch when the intent of the compute Switch was to address the decreasing hashrate for ETH/ETC miners.

I was able to run cinebench with 3 different motherboards mounting a TR1950X.


Here my results:


Asrock Fatal1ty score 3000+


Gigabyte Designare EX score 2800+


Asus Zenith Extreme score 2800+


I also tried to figure out the culprit of this difference in performance, all the systems have NO OC, same cooling product, use an SSD and have the same amount of RAM configured at the same speed of 3200Mhz.
However there is a big difference in the default CPU voltage, Gigabyte and Asus have a default auto voltage of 1.40+ rising temperatures too fast when under load resulting in worse performance.

ASRock is actually providing voltage to the CPU with better stability and without increasing it too much, this results in better performance overall and less heat."

Is there any AMD card that would be an upgrade over the 480 that's still relatively  affordable? I was thinking Pro Duo or 390X (there are a Pro Duo and a 390X near me for 700 and 350€ respectively), but I'd have to upgrade my PSU for either one of them."

Amd,tokyoaro,18,1,Looking To Build A Ryzen Machine. Can I Get Some Feedback?
Amd,CocoaThumper,30,0,"Does AMD really need to stay in the GPU market?I just got done watching the recent Linus video regarding Vega Frontier and the Vega launch in general. Given what a botch this launch has been with regard to drivers, pricing, engineering decisions, overall performance, etc...is it wise for AMD to stay in the GPU game?

Im seeing posts about how Raja really screwed the pooch at RTG, and how RTG is such a disappointment when compared to the CPU division. Hell, Ive started wondering if it was ever wise for AMD to purchase ATI back in the day. But I dont know much of the inner working regarding AMD's fices back then.

Anyways, Ill wrap this up. Seeing as AMD did benefit when they released Global Foundries into the wild to run solo...is this something you think would need to happen with RTG?

Given AMD's size and the funds they have, its really difficult for them to continually trying to fight two giants (Intel and Nvidia) who were kicking their butts for so long. Ryzen allowed AMD to come roaring back in the CPU battle...but the Radeon division is just the opposite right now.

Thoughts?"

Amd,h3llhound,13,6,"Ryzen Motherboard QVL Lists (Resubmitted with discussion flair)Hello,

I have a question about the QVL Lists and maybe someone knows more. Many of the Kits listed are a bit insane, like the F4-3200C14Q2-64GVK. A 3200MHz 64GB Quad Kit on a Gigabyte B350 Gaming 3.

Can I assume, that since the the quad kit is supported to run at 3200, that the dual kit is as well? My thought is, it makes no difference to use the dual kit or just half of the quad one.

I'm looking to buy a Ryzen system but the lackluster QVL lists apart from MSI are driving my nuts as I rarely find a 16Gb 3200MHz kit in there. But then again the MSI Bios and general support is not well perceived in this subreddit which is a point against MSI.

2) The 1% of the times it works, if I activate Relive Instant Replay, the mouse will randomly stops to work ingame.
3) Relive is taking much more performance than in the past.

EDIT: The more I test, the more behaviours I find among different games:

- Rainbow Six Siege: Overlay heavily flickering, Relive blocking the mouse on fullscreen (not on borderless fullscreen) and greatly impacts the fps (the counter says 100+ but it looks like 20ish, both full and borderless)
- Prey: Overlay not working at all, some performance drop with Relive (from 60fps capped to a bit less than 60)
- Euro Truck Simulator 2: everything works perfectly on fullscreen (AND I LOVE IT!), Overlay not working in not-fullscreen (dunno about Relive)

Is there a way to report these findings to AMD?

1)Before i had an older driver, Windows 7 and 1x8GB of RAM (Single Channel).   
2)Now i have Adrenalin Driver, Windows 10 and 2x8GB of RAM (Dual Channel). 
 
Seeing the number of the driver in the results it was 17.8.2 (on Windows 7).

I haven't taken any pictures but the stock thermal paste application seemed perfectly fine. Maybe I got these results because I used Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut.

I know it will be more futureproof than a 1060 but between bad reviews on websites and them running significantly hotter I have my reservations.

I want something that is reliable and runs cool. This room has no air conditioning come summer so I need something with lots of thermal headroom.

On the other hand it has lots of good reviews too, so I don't know. I heard good things about gigabyte, but after my z270 fiasco I'm not touching that with a 10 foot pole. Also hearing good things about sapphire, but they're expensive as fudge. I'd like to keep it to around $300ish if possible.

The system was pretty cool under stress tests and were very cool while gaming.The VCORE would stay at around 1.35v on auto under load, with a very rare dip into 1.375, so I let it stay auto. 

I'm running the same windows 10 version as before, no change in power options (or BIOS) either. I check for windows and windows defender updates on a daily basis.

I ran through AIDA64 system stability test forever without problems. All of a sudden I cannot OC my CPU to even 3.6GHz with stock (2133mhz) RAM without it failing the AIDA64 test. I tried upgrading my BIOS to 1001 version from ASUS, but the same problem persists. Could anyone understand any of this? I can't even ""OC"" it to under stock clocks without it failing the test, so I'm trying to find other answers to this atm. 

Could viruses do something like this?

I've tested this setup on water cooling, and the CPU runs 3.95GHz on around 1.4-1.42v stable, but I've run it a bit lower with the stock cooler because the water cooler I bought was defect. I have never used to CPU on more than 1.375v for extended periods, so I don't think there is any chance of degredation either. I can't figure it out."

Amd,copiousbootysweat,30,1,"Vega 56 (Stock Bios) Overclocking/Undervolting IssueAlright so I recently got the Gigabyte version of the card and I managed to find a solid undervolt but it was giving me some crashes after I'd close games and Radeon settings would randomly stop responding at times too. Those problems were a bit unfortunate since I found a really great sweet spot with a Firestrike GPU score of 22 571 with stock bios and everything. I decided to just DDU the driver and reinstall it, to the same version I believe since I've only had the card for about a week. 

Prior to the installation my HWmonitor was displaying a fixed core clock more or less at full load. [Right now it's bouncing in between P5-P7 while I'm playing games, running hotter, and giving me about 1000 less on firestrike.](https://i.gyazo.com/afbbb9c207b9671ee88325dd2c74b048.png) It isn't the same exact undervolt but even with the old one I was getting these weird bounces and it felt as if the voltages weren't applying. I tried on both wattman and the overdrive tools. My game performance is still great but I'm missing those sub 70 temps and better performance I had before. 

I guess my question is, is this an issue with the cards and is there anything I can do to figure out the problem?


Edit: this is currently the problem I'm facing right now. This is with p6/1030 and p7/1080: https://i.gyazo.com/72620983846587d6010b4555557b4d23.mp4 . it just shouldnt be drawing 250w with those undervolts so it seems like the voltage isnt applying"

- One solution that I was thinking off is removing the covering and the default fan, then just slap on a different fan and kinda angle it so that the air flow can go through the default heat sink.  Does this even work?  If so, how effective is this method?

Amd,rhayndihm,54,11,"Zen2 and Zen 3 CCX vs Zeppelin DiesHello all, another discussion :). The idea here is the concept of bringing more cores into future Zen releases.

Armed with the knowledge that Epyc would be 48 core (and the 64 core) threw Reddit into a tizzy. They claimed that AMD could do this by increasing number of cores per CCX.

I... don't... think that is a good idea. Here's why!

~~When you have 4 cores in a CCX, you have 6 connections total required to 1-1 connect each core to eachother. 
~~
~~People propose 6 cores per CCX. This would mean you either ringbus the architecture or you find some attractive way to pipeline 18 1-1 connections across the CCX. Things get even worse when you're looking at 8 cores per CCX.... It's problematic.~~ **Edit: 15 1-1 connections, not 18. Damn you, Gauss.**

**EDIT - I've been informed (a bunch) that there isn't a 1-1 connection; but more like each core in the CCX pushing and pulling from L3 when another core needs what one has. This does simplify CCX design and allow for simpler upgrading of cores per CCX.**

Instead, I have a stinking suspicion that they'd rather cram more CCX's onto the zeppelin die. **For those not in the know, a zeppelin die has 2 Core CompleXes and each ccx has a quad core in it.**

Ryzen has 1 zeppelin die. Epyc and Threadripper have 4 zeppelin dies (but 2 have been disabled for the latter).

With 2 CCX's, you only need 1 1-1 connection. But when you add a third CCX, you instantly increase the number of cores by 50% with almost no work except pathing in 2 1-1 connections. Adding a 4th CCX is similarly trivial, and they already have the pathing from the CCX, so it's just copied from CCX to Die to (ultimately) package.

This means zen2 could have 12 cores max, and zen3 could have 16 cores max; all with FAR less work than trying to cram more cores per CCX.

**TL;DR - I expect they'll increase number of CCX per zeppelin die. I DO NOT expect they'll increase number of cores per CCX.**

Here's how the breakdown goes.

3CCX = 

* 12 core - 24thread
* 9 core - 18thread
* 6 core - 12thread

4CCX =

* 16 core - 32 thread
* 12 core - 24 thread
* 8 core - 16 thread"

Seeing as games get optimized for more cores and my 2600K show its age more and more, I am deciding of replacing my current rig. Somebody is selling me an x79 board with an I7 3930k for about 250$. I currently have 16gb of DDR3 so this may be an advantage on cost. I can get a R7 1600 cpu and board for about 300$ but I need to buy DDR4 ram which are really overpriced these days. How do you think the 3930K compare to current AMD offerings such as the 1600 or the 1700? Has anyone of you made the jump from a 3930K to a Ryzen system? How are you liking it so far? Or should I just wait for Zen+?

PS. I am disgusted about the non soldered CPUs from Intel that is why going Kaby/Coffeelake is not an option for me as I plan to OC. Also, the thing that put me off Ryzen is the memory support which demands better (pricier) ram to get the highest gaming performance due to CCX.

Anyway, forget the microtransactions for a moment. If we look at the game by itself, it is unarguably impressive. I mean truly a marvel. There are many holy crap moments. They did a good job. 

The multiplayer seems destined to be unbalanced. Forget buying anything. You have to level up stuff just to unlock other things, similar to COD style. In COD it seems to work better since there are so many weapons and attachments to choose from. But in this game there isn't as many weapons or attachments, so the unlock walls are harder. My fav weapon from the campaign I need to kill 500 as heavy trooper just to unlock. 500 kills might not seem that bad, but as I have found out some people skipped the campaign completely. They are high players kicking my butt. I'm suiciding trying to get those kills as assault. I'm sure this problem won't be as apparent once there are more players for matchmaking. Still it should be mentioned. 

I would say that if you are a fan of StarWars, get the game. I'm sure it will be on sale at some point. If you feel bad about buying the game, just wait for a while and see if a killer sale comes. I would pay 20 bucks just for the campaign. So if thats your number I'm sure the game will get there at some point. If you want to play multiplayer, just consider it a cinematic experience and goof around. How much is it worth it? 30 bucks for campaign and multiplayer? Buy it when it hits that price.

If they pissed you off so much, then I wouldn't buy. But perhaps in 2 years the game will be 5 bucks on a humble bundle. Definitely pick it up for that price. Like I said the campaign is worth atleast 20 bucks.

This is a continuation from another one of my recent posts [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/7cpm78/rx_vega_56_with_64_bios_results/).  Being an engineer, I decided I wanted to have some fun and execute a response surface design of experiment (DOE) with my RX Vega 56 (64 air BIOS) to find settings that gave good performance with minimal power draw.  My intention is NOT to get the highest score possible.  These results might vary from others as every card and setup is different, but maybe this information will give some insight for settings to start with if you are looking for balanced, everyday settings.

***

***Conclusion:***

I put this at the top in case there are people that want the good stuff without reading the rest haha.

Basically Core Clock and Power Limit have a linear relationship with Firestrike Scores (as you increase those settings scores increase).  Memory Clock and Voltage have a non-linear relationship with Firestrike Scores (scores increase ONLY up to a certain point then start to decrease, in my case this is about a Memory Clock of 1040MHz and a Voltage of 1080mV). This could be in direct relation to the fact that the actual Core Clock reading increases up to the same Voltage and then starts decreasing.

Core Clock DID NOT affect Power draw. Memory Clock, Voltage, and Power Limit have a linear relationship with Power draw (Max Power decreases as you increase Memory Clock, and increases as you increase Voltage and Power Limit).

My optimized and everyday settings (maximizing Firestrike Score and minimizing Power draw) ended up being 1592MHz Core Clock, 1024MHz Memory Clock, 1007mV Voltage (p6, p7, and memory), and 50% Power Limit.  I bumped Voltage up to 1010mV for stability.

Of course, you might get different results if you try higher Voltages and Core Clocks, which I might try out in the future!

* Voltage = ALL voltages (p6, p7, and memory). Memory voltage is core voltage floor.
* P6 clock was fixed at stock 1532MHz
* Fan curve 1000-3500

***

***Factors:***

The factors and levels included in this DOE are shown in the table below.  These were chosen based on my previous testing (link in background section above).  I wanted settings that would not cause crashing at any level combination and with a wide as possible window.  I likely knew going in that the sweet spot for core clock would be in the 1500MHz range, which ended up not being the case as my optimized Core Clock was my highest level (it is never that great to have a setting that was your highest/lowest limit in your DOE).

Factor|Levels
:-:|:-:
Core Clock (MHz)|1502, 1547, 1592
Memory Clock (MHz)|950, 1025, 1100
Voltage (mV)|950, 1050, 1150
Power Limit (%)|0, 25, 50

***

***Outputs:***

* Max Core Clock (MHz)
* Max Voltage (mV)
* Max Core Temperature (°C)
* Max HBM Temperature
* Max Hot Spot Temperature
* **Max Power (W)**
* **Firestrike Graphics Score** (Normal will be used as I got complaints using extreme last time)

I also calculated the Performance-to-Power ratio (Score/Max Power).

***

***DOE and Results:***

Images that I will be referring to below can be found [here](https://imgur.com/a/9rAwW). These are numbered which I will refer to when discussing.

The DOE run order and results can be found in Image 1.  There was a total of 31 runs, randomized.

The outputs I am focusing on in this analysis are the Firestrike Scores and Max Power, however if anyone wants information on the other outputs they are more than welcome to ask.

**Firestrike Score:**

* The significant factors and terms that contributed to Firestrike Scores are shown in Image 2.  Backwards elimination was used to remove insignificant terms (alpha = 0.05).
* The main effects plot for significant factors are shown in Image 3.  Core Clock and Power Limit have a linear effect, where scores increase when increasing these factors.  Memory Clock and Voltage have a non-linear effect, where scores increase up to a certain point and then start to drop.  In this case scores start to drop around a Memory Clock of 1040MHz and a Voltage of 1080mV. This could be in direct relation to the fact that the actual Core Clock reading increases up to the same Voltage and starts decreasing, shown in Image 4.
* The interaction plots for significant terms are shown in Image 5.  The Memory Clock * Voltage interaction term does not seem to have a significant effect (lines do not cross).  However, the Voltage * Power Limit interaction term does have an effect.  As Power Limit is increased, scores start to drop at a higher Voltage (for example, scores start to drop at around a Voltage of 1050mV with a Power Limit of 0%, but drop later at around a Voltage of 1110mV with a Power Limit of 50%).
* Model (R-Sq Adj 88.34%): -106724 + [5.62 * Core Clock (MHz)] + [123.7 * Memory Clock (MHz)] + [106.1 * Voltage (mV)] – [173.6 * Power Limit (%)] – [0.0734 * Memory Clock (MHz) * Memory Clock (MHz)] – [0.0639 * Voltage (mV) * Voltage (mV)] + [0.02602 * Memory Clock (MHz) * Voltage (mV)] + [0.1806 * Voltage (mV) * Power Limit (%)]


**Max Power:**

* The significant factors that contribute to Power draw are shown in Image 6.  Backwards elimination was used to remove insignificant terms (alpha = 0.05).
* The main effects plot for significant factors are shown in Image 7.  Memory Clock, Voltage, and Power Limit have a linear effect (Max Power decreases when increasing Memory Clock, and increases when increasing Voltage and Power Limit).  Core Clock did not have a significant effect.
* The interaction plots for significant terms are shown in Image 8.  The Memory Clock * Voltage interaction term was not pronounced (lines do not cross).  However, the Memory Clock * Power Limit and the Voltage * Power Limit interaction terms do have an effect.  If you increase Memory Clock or Voltage, Max Power consumption will increase faster if you have a greater Power Limit (for example, going from a Voltage of 950mV to 1150mV increased the Max Power consumption by about 60W with a Power Limit of 50%, but would only increase by 20W with a Power Limit of 0%).
* Model (R-Sq Adj 92.15%): 1290 – [1.210 * Memory Clock (MHz)] – [0.862 * Voltage (mV)] – [12.03 * Power Limit (%)] + [0.000992 * Memory Clock (MHz) * Voltage (mV)] + [0.00370 * Memory Clock (MHz) * Power Limit (%)] + [0.008075 * Voltage (mV) * Power Limit (%)]


***

***Optimization:***

Optimized settings are shown in the table below.  Settings were found by minimizing Max Power and maximizing Firestrike Score.  Firestrike was ran using these optimized settings and compared to the predicted results.

**Core Clock (MHz)**|**Memory Clock (MHz)**|**Voltage (mV)**|**Power Limit (%)**|Predicted Firestrike|Predicted Max Power|Actual Firestrike Score|Actual Max Power
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
**1592**|**1024**|**1007**|**50**|21180|199|21429|224


The Firestrike score was a little higher than predicted and Power draw was also a little higher than predicted.  This is expected as I have seen a lot of variation in scores and power draw with Vega.  I probably could have gotten closer results if I did multiple runs, but I did not have time for that plus I wasn’t looking for anything spectacular. These settings result in a 98.8% in the Firestrike Stress Test.  For normal use I will probably increase the voltage to 1010mV for more stability.

If anyone wants me to do another optimization with different outputs, I would be more than happy to do so.

***

**Also, later in the day I seem to get these errors where before Firestrike even starts my computer instantly goes into a restart loop, with an error code 00 on my Taichi.  I don’t think this is a memory instability issue because it still happens when I revert back to auto settings.  I also don’t think it is an overclocking issue because I have increased the voltage significantly and I still get the issue as well.  This only happens during the night.  Maybe power issues?  Any help would be appreciated!!**"

I have couple of issues but mainly 2 really annoy me.

- bois and windows sees 64GB but windowna has  31.9 usable?
- timing / speed / manual tuning 

It boots and runs windows on auto.
If I try to tune the ram timings it just reboots 5x and reverts to detected.

I loosen the CA's times right up and nothing. Cant even get numbers for ryzen stock times, does anyone else have this ram?"
Amd,jdrodrig,59,51,"Ryzen 2500U some benchmarks and strange readingsI have been playing with the BestBuy HP Ryzen 5 machine for a few hours. so far a very pleasant experience, with the obvious drawback of the spinning disk.
wanted to share some stats and also some strange readings most likely due to standard monitoring tools not been updated to latest skus,
1. First the strange, somehow HWinfo64 reports low core by core speeds while windows task manager seems to report the correct value. for instance, if I let the CPU-Z stress run, task manager will report speed of about 2.7Ghz, yet HWinfo64 reports Core 0 running at 393 Mhz and Core 1 to Core 3 running at 786 Mhz. As you can guess, if I add up the four numbers I get something close to the 2.7 see here [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/elqAn9E.png)

2. A trivial omission. CPU-Z still does not show a logo for the Ryzen CPU, see [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/HEyILVi.png)

3. On the good news, I am getting CineBench R15 at CPU 614 and GPU 47 fps. see [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/f4L5I4Q.png) I think the CPU is on par with the 6700HQ.

4. as I reported yesterday, I am getting FireStrike at 2243 [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/BGekzH3.png); and the Fire Strike stress test is passed with 98.1% [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/D1AlAhU.png)"

Amd,Derelinquoo,5,2,"Ryzen 7 1700 &amp; Gigabyte AX370 K5 - RAM Compatibility Question - November 2017Hello,

I've been researching RAM for the past few days and I'm still a little lost, I'm at the end but need a little more help... I think.

I've purchased a Gigabyte Gaming K5 and Ryzen 7 1700 and would like to buy the last piece of my PC build (RAM). Currently there is a list of compatible memory modules provided by AMD located at the following link:
https://www.amd.com/system/files/2017-06/am4-motherboard-memory-support-list-en_0.pdf

As well as additional memory QVL from Gigabyte located here:
http://www.gigabyte.us/Motherboard/GA-AX370-Gaming-K5-rev-10#support-doc

From these I gather that the lists are not currently up-to-date AMD-June, Gigabyte-March
So, my information is approximately 5+ months outdated.

I then found the B-die list (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/62vp2g/clearing_up_any_samsung_bdie_confusion_eg_on/) and found that some of the B-die list RAM modules were on the AMD Compatibility PDF. Specifically, F4-3000C14D-32GTZ. 

https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16820232202
F4-3000C14D-32GTZ 
However, the QVL from gskill does not mention any AMD based Motherboards  https://www.gskill.com/en/product/f4-3000c14d-32gtz)

Five lines down I noticed the F4-3200C14D-32GVK

https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?item=N82E16820232218
F4-3200C14D-32GVK
However, the QVL from gskill does not mention any AMD based Motherboards (https://www.gskill.com/en/product/f4-3200c14d-32gvk)

At the time of this post the GVK is 369.99 (Sale at newegg.com) and the GTZ is 398.99. My rationalizations tell me that the GVK is what I should purchase seeing as how none of the QVLs matter and it returns faster clock speeds and identical latency at a lower cost, while using a B-die which seems to be quite compatible with Ryzen (also, it matches my build aesthetically). I can't really come to a conclusion with so much missing information, and I'd hate to have to pay restocking fees and endure shipping wait times which may overrun the lifetime of the return policy on some of my already purchased parts (assuming there may be defects with the product). 

Should I purchase the f4-3200c14d-32GVK? Would you suggest something entirely different? I'll set a budget at USD$400.

I'd really appreciate the help, and I'm sure others with a similar question who have done this research would as well. I never thought RAM would be giving me the most difficult time for a PC build.

*Note: I will be using this build for Game Design - Blender, Substance Designer, Substance Painter, Zbrush, KeyShot, Unreal Engine 4, Autodesk fusion 360, etc.

Thank you."
Amd,3yebex,13,13,"AMD Enhanced Sync - Possible Driver Issue Still Not Fixed OR Listed As Known Issue###What Is The Issue?

When two monitors are plugged in, certain games **will not** be able to launch while Enhanced Sync is enabled in AMD's settings.

This issue was posted on [AMD's Community](https://community.amd.com/thread/219721) forums back in **August, 28**. I have gotten no response, reply, or acknowledgement after 152 thread views. I also briefly touched on this in the /r/AMD Discord a while back as well.

**EDIT**: Video of issue: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pawd2lrJmfw)

###Other Information -
* Applications run fine, with Enhanced Sync, if a **single monitor** is connected.
* My setup includes a 144hz (primary, second connection) and 60hz (secondary, first connection) with an RX 480.
* Seems to be related to Source-Engine games and similar engines, but isn't specific to DX9 games.

I'm not asking for support, as I'm pretty confident it can't be solved currently. I just want this to get noticed so I can finally use Enhanced Sync when I have my dual monitors.

I understand I had an odd issue like this before, from user error which we discovered was **Morphological Filtering** for DX9 applications. However, I can't see any user error right now when it works perfectly fine with a single monitor.

There is simply little to no information on Enhanced Sync and troubleshooting it, and it's really bothering me."

Amd,Lon3Wo1f,37,12,"[PSA] Vega Custom Water Block Users With Bad TempsI recently bought a Bykski Vega block for my 64, and was getting horrific temperatures. Like 80C+ core and 110C+ Hot Spot. It was so bad that my card was throttling down to ~900 MHz, no matter how much I downclocked it.


I first thought it was my installation, so I redid the card twice, but still kept getting sky high temps and crashing.


**What solved it was the X-bracket that originally came with the stock cooler. This bracket is required for installation, having screws is NOT enough.** I'm guessing that the PCB is not stiff enough to maintain pressure on the die, so it flexes away from my block.


So if you are getting poor temps with your custom block, try putting back on the X-Bracket. I know EK doesn't mention it in their installation guide, but that's what solved my problems.


Hope this helps anyone else having issues with a block.


Also, the Bykski block works great. Getting 40C Core/55C Hot Spot with my Vega. It can be bought for bargain prices through Taobao, I think mine cost $80 shipped to USA."

https://pixiogaming.com/products/new-px277

and

http://www.nixeus.com/product/nixeus-edg27/

They're both very similar, if not exactly the same.

They both have, in terms of resolution (2560x1440), freesync range (30-144hz), price (399.99 msrp), panel type (AHVA) but there's a few things I don't know about. I understand that the EDG 27 is one of the first monitors to have adaptive overdrive (Off, low medium and high). The New PX277 also has an option called Overdrive (only on and off), but is it the same feature? Also, since the New PX277 has much thinner bezels does it have more backlight bleed? IPS glow? And since the PX277 has a minimum response time of 6ms grey-to-grey, how can it achieve true 144hz since in general black-to-white as opposed to grey-to-grey will typically produce a response time that's higher. For 144hz a minimum of 6.9 miliseconds is required and I'm sure they black-to-white is going to be higher than that? The same can be asked about the Nixeus since it has 4ms grey-to-grey. Is this what adaptive overdrive is used for?

Anyway. I just wanted to know if the community has any info regarding these two monitors, since they're both very compelling purchases, especially now that Vega is out. Any feedback would be appreciated!

Here are the screenshots https://imgur.com/a/LXJDn

Since I only game at 1920x1200 60MHz my trusty old R9 290 is a bit overkill for my Steam collection. So I decided to see how well it can be tamed. I've done this well over a year ago, but only now got around to crunch some numbers, take some screenshots and share my results.

Before we begin, a few things to keep in mind:

-GPU-Z Power only registers the Core power draw on AMD cards. In my case you have to add around ~40W for the memory, fans and whatnot to reach the GPU TDP.

-I haven't bothered overclocking the memory any further than 1375MHz, and for these tests I've left it at stock 1260MHz.

-I'm running on an old i7 2600K @ 3.6GHz @ 1.08V with 16GB RAM undervolted to 1333MHz @ 1.24V. My power supply is a Corsair AX850. At idle, the wall power draw is 68-70W while a CPU-Z stress test takes it all the way to 112-117W (the CPU doesn't exceed 45-47c depending on room temp).

-the results are obtained running Fire Strike Graphics Test 2 on loop for 5 minutes. There's probably a margin of error of 5-10W and a few seconds which might influence the GPUZ averages.

-all settings are perfectly stable, with zero artifacts, tested long term in various games, including Doom, Witcher 3, Tomb Raider, etc.

Lets begin:


-Stock clock 1000MHz and stock voltage 1.25V.
Max Current: 19.9A Max Core Power: 224W Wall Power: 325-340W. ~13500 frames rendered in the 5min loop.


-1075MHz clock at 1.193V
Max Current: 18.1A Max Core Power: 209W Wall Power: 300-320W. ~14700 frames rendered.


-Stock clock 1000MHz at 1.137V:
Max Current: 14.8A Max Core Power: 169W Wall Power: 265-280W. ~13700 frames rendered.


-825MHz clock at 0.993V
Max Current: 8.6A Max Core Power: 102W Wall Power: 210-220W. ~11500 frames rendered.


At 825MHz / 0.993V (which is what i've been running it at for the past few months) the old 290 becomes more power efficient than a GTX960 while still being significantly more powerful. All while never exceeding 55-60c.

So in conclusion, if you haven't tried undervolting your Hawaii yet, you're missing out! For some reason AMD likes applying way too much voltage. Maybe it's a binning issue and I just got very lucky, but they seem to be doing the same thing even today with Vega so it's probably not a fluke.

The board is still aimed for a 23rd October release, but Asus has released not a bit of information about this, apart from announcing it. On the other hand Intel already got the Z370-I released...

But jokes on them, we got the better sound-card as far as I can tell (the Intel one misses anything but the headphone amplifier) and we also got an adressable RGB header PLUS a normal one!"

Im going from a i7 2600k with a gtx 1070 and 16gb 1333 ddr3 to a ryzen 5 1600 and a gtx 1080 and 8gb 2100 ddr4. I was wondering if the 1600 will be good enough or should i sell it and get a 1700. Will it make much difference for gaming and compiling/ running code? Also can the 1600 be overclocked safely with the stock cooler? 
Amd,uppermosteN,23,13,"Raven Ridge and FreesyncKind of a PSA post; this is just me realizing that Raven Ridge is going to hit a huge chunk of the market and is going to hit well ([basically RX 550 graphics performance for SFF PCs/media boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3z5IjmSL2M)).

Not sure if it has been confirmed yet but if RR will support Freesync &amp; Freesync 2, which I believe is highly likely, will enable great new possibilities of building cheap media/living room/streaming PCs with no compromise for CPU/GPU performance. And I feel that there will be much more interest for this

*****

Gamers will be interested in Raven Ridge, sure, especially people who are slowly switching from a console. Esports might work well on it but if you're a gamer, you might invest for something more. These APUs, on the other hand, will fly off the shelves into secondary media PCs to complement the primary build with leisure usage. Just my 2 cents and I'm not even thinking laptop market for now."

CPU is a R5 1400 @ 3.8Ghz 

I have a secondary VR pc for our living room. I was looking at liquid cooling everything since I have it mine eth in the off hours. Single card doesn't do much but eh. Eventually I will use it to purchase a Vega 56. Will probably liquid cool that too.

I got a Kraken G12 (w/ H55 AIO) for my GTX 1070 but found it didn't fit. Bit of clean up on the 1070 and it was off to the races on the 480. I found that with the stock shroud off the gpu it would crash. probably due to vrm or memory overheating. I decided to get the stock shroud on for the cooling on the vrm/memory

I cut into the G12 to resize and fit in the stock shroud and use the blower. It required cutting a lot of plastic and kind of ruining the airflow on the blower, for now. I will be 3d printing parts to replace what I have cut and improve airflow. 

With the shroud back on the card and up and running it's time to stress test. Firing up eth miner and let it go to town over night.

Idle temps are in the mid to high 20's. 100% load we are looking at ~43c. Much improved over the 80c that would cause the 480 to crash before and the reason I stopped using it. Still deciding on where the 1070 is going."

Just curious if anyone would be interested in my sapphire rx 480 8gb reference card mod? 

Basically I took the best advice people posted online and made a total overkill setup using that. 

Long story short, used the complete [Arctic Hybrid II-120](https://www.arctic.ac/eu_en/accelero-hybrid-ii-120.html) package, put my own fan in, kept the stock encasing to cool the VRM and VRAM (even though I prepared myself with loads of small copper heatsinks, but didn't feel like it in the end). 

So atm, everything is stuffed in my case Air 240, fans everywhere :D 

On top of that, I also flashed the RX580 vBIOS onto my reference card, with a maximum voltage of 1.250 - more on this if people are interested. 

Anyways all in all, maximum 61 *C VRM temp and max 54 *C core temp. Repasted with conductonaut liquid metal. 
Without any tinkering, I managed to reach 1440 on core and 2300 on my samsung memory without any errors at all. 

But yeah, if anyone is interested I will a in-depth tutorial on how I did it all. 


Thanks for reading :-)

Just got it, box was definitely opened. Date is 2017 Week 08 on the CPU (possibly affected by SegFault?). Anything to look out for? No residue of any thermal paste on it (although it could have been cleaned really well). Pins all look good, no discoloration on the IHS. 

I'm going to be putting it in an MSI Carbon Pro X370 board (4 months old on Kijiji, $100). This ends up being a super cheap build. I'm coming from a 7700K and a Gigabyte Z270 Gaming 5 board. 

Any tests I should run? I guess it's anyone's guess why it was returned or opened. Has an ""Amazon Inspected"" sticker on the box but I highly doubt they actually tested it lol...

For those that are wondering why I am replacing the 7700K: Only because of the deal on the board and CPU. I figure I would give it a shot to see what the hype was all about and play around with it. I figure I could sell the CPU and board for at minimum of what I paid so I doubt I'll lose out on the deal. I'm thinking if it works well and surprises me, I might just build it into a separate machine.

I guess the question is, should I do a SegFault test on it and if it fails, RMA it immediately to get a brand new CPU? Was there a date code range that 100% confirms if it's affected? I read somewhere that it was pre week 25.

Amd,willnuckles,49,19,"[PSA] My Vega 56 caused my machine to hard reset under heavy load, and a new PSU fixed it.I wanted to share my experience in case others come up against this. I've seen other issues stemming from my setup, but I only saw one other instance of actual hard resets.

**Tl;dr** - A single cable with two 8-pin adapters caused my machine to hard reset. Using two separate cables solved my problem.

[My old PSU](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817182200) was not up to the challenge of pushing my Vega 56. I was using a single wire with two 8-pin connectors at the end. That PSU only comes with two separate 8-pin wires, and the other was powering my CPU. The EVGA 1070 I had previously did not have any issues with this setup. I read that using that setup sometimes caused coil whine, but other than that, there was no reason to believe it could cause hard machine resets. 

The weird part was it would run Time Spy with zero issues. Got back an average score. Good to go. I decided to stretch it's legs on the new Battlefront demo. After selecting a match, I would get into the game, be able to move a small bit, get horrible hard stutters, an audio loop, then that dreaded sound of all your case fans winding down. I tried again with the same results. Switching to the benchmarking tool in GTA V had the same results. 

[I found a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPFAxgebhYE) where a YouTuber had the same problem as me. One of his users suggested running two separate cables, and it fixed his issue. I didn't have an extra 8-pin cable, so I purchased [a new PSU](https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817438017&amp;cm_re=g2_750w-_-17-438-017-_-Product), and the only problem I have is that I missed the Battlefront beta.

Liquid vs Air Vega FEsHey all, so a few months ago I got a new system from my friends at AMD (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/6q6c6h/thanks_a_million_to_amd_for_the_new_system/) rocking a Ryzen 1700 and a Vega FE... Now it's time for another upgrade!


I'm a full-time VR dev, and have a company that creates interactive visualizations, simulations, and game prototypes. 


As of late, the work we've been doing could use some more firepower. 


We used to do a lot of work in UE4, but have been transitioning to Unity due to client requests for it. As opposed to doing light baking on the CPU, we're going to transition to the GPU-based Octane rendering in Unity when it launches shortly for AMD cards.


Additionally, I'm a huge gamer, and want to play as many games as possible at 4K. 


I know that there is a performance difference between the Vega FE Air vs Liquid. I've never overclocked a machine in my life, nor have I ever had anything other than air cooled parts. Sooo... What should I be running?


4 x Air Cooled FEs?
1 Liquid Cooled FE and 3 Air Cooled FEs?
4 Liquid Cooled FEs?
4 Air Cooled FEs with Liquid Blocks? 


I play pretty much every new game, if it supports Crossfire, I'll use two of them in Crossfire, while rendering content in the background on the other two cards.


My 4K monitor on order is Freesync compatible, but its only a 60hz screen (The 43'' LG 4K display). 


Please let me know your thoughts. I have no idea what the upkeep is like on a liquid cooled machine, or the pitfalls, but for the sake of rendering, light baking, and the amount of last minute projects that I have to burn through in a hurry to make a deadline, the more GPUs the better!


Please give me some advice!


Thanks!

It seems like the card is not using the voltages set in Wattman and it maxes out at 1.150V (instead ~1.118V).

This causes uneccessary power consumtion and heat build-up.

Also, I am not sure if the card is really undervolted. I can confirm that clocks set in Wattman are applied properly...


My settings are (last 3 states):

When I have the RAM set to over 2400mhz my computer will occasionally go on a reboot cycle till it eventually starts and the RAM will appear stable after that. It's worked all the way up to 2966mhz. But only when I have it set to the 2400mhz mark it appears to have no booting difficulty. I have updated the latest BIOS so I'm not sure what to do. I have seen that the latest update has helped people reach the potential of this particular RAM with no problem whatsoever. Also, one thing I noticed is that my tRC is at 68 at 2966 when it should be around 56 according to the SPD tab in cpu-z. Could this be the issue? Again, the only thing that appears to malfunction is the system having to reboot several times on startup to finally get going and it doesn't do that every time even. I'd love to be able to get the most out of it without issue and if I'm not able to I'm most likely just going to try and return the RAM to Microcenter and pick up something else. "

What do you guys think about my temps?  I feel like they are safe but I'd like to see little better. Thought about replacing the stock thermal paste it see if it improved any. 

I was thinking about maybe backing it down to 3.5 if it crashed while gaming.

Amd,DeadMan3000,11,4,"Are benchmarking software like 3DMark really useful?I've been playing around with my RX Vega 56 and comparing benchmarks to other owners and other GPU's and have come to the following conclusions. Benchmarking software like 3DMark is not extremely useful. Why? Well there are a couple of reasons for this I believe. The one major problem I have with 3DMark in particular is that GPU utilization on some GPU's changes with time. Many modern GPU's do not rely on a fixed clock rate but boost when conditions are favorable. Typically this means that unless you can sustain a constant clock rate you will get varying results and it is easy to 'cheat' the system. I've seen people posting insane benchmarks but because the benchmarks last for generally short periods of time.  They show boost clock speeds that actually reduce over time as thermals kick in. This tends to sway scores and show GPU's with fixed clocks in a bad light. Generally I would prefer a benchmark that can run for a longer period of time so this does not skew results (I think I would trust a Unigine Heaven benchmark run 'after' 10 minutes than 3DMark). Also there is the fact that many review sites tend to post the overall socres rather than the graphic scores (why do they do that?). Secondly, most benchmarking software is proprietary, meaning you cannot verify if they are unbiased or not (The same problem could be said of inbuilt benchmarks of course, especially if they are something like Gameworks titles).

Or am I wrong here? What do you think?"

Here you can see that over 50 Ryzen 1800X Box Edition (standard retail) are on sale for 400€ each. This is not something that a retailer will do without reason, as the 1800X was selling pretty well even at 430€. It most likely means that AMD is adjusting their pricing scheme to stay competitive with Coffee Lake: The 1800X might be lowered to 8700k prices. Here a overview: (in the comments since the subreddit style destroys tables in posts)



I am predicting the R7 1700 to go down to 270€ in order to compete with the i5 8600k, and possibly to set up the R5 1600 vs i3 8350k and R5 1600X against i5 8400. This would ensure that the Ryzen's are compared at what they are best at: 1600 and 1700 overclocked compared to the 8350k and 8600k while 1600X and 1700X against the 8400 and 8700 at stock.

Amd,anihallatorx,69,16,"Ryzen's reputation after Coffee Lake comes out?I was thinking about this for a while, so here we are. It has been 5 months since Ryzen launched and phew, what a time it's been. It was nothing short of a miracle for both AMD and more importantly us, the consumers. The processors got all the coverage and praise they deserved, there was a slew of controversies that followed naturally, but the general global consensus was that Ryzen was a win, with even some average buyers recognizing the merits of Ryzen over their Intel competitors. 

And obviously, things haven't been quiet at Intel. It doesn't require a genius to understand that their string of decisions on X299, the i9s and the marketing malice that followed is attributed to Ryzen's success and growing popularity. They were obviously quite bothered by this. Now Coffee Lake seems to be just around the corner and rumors point to more cores, so essentially a complete re-segmentation of their line up in a long, long time. And Ryzen has played a role in making us, the enthusiasts, the tech press and some percentage of the normal consumer acknowledge or atleast recognize Intel's anti consumer practices, corporate control and lack of innovation over the years. It is a quavering hot-topic right now and is something that quite often pops up here and there. 

Now here is where my question begins. Coffee Lake will obviously sell very well. Even if they change the socket, the performance in games should be higher than Ryzen. Will this take the scenario back to where it was before Ryzen launched? Will people still think of Ryzen as the real game changer, understanding the difference that competition can bring, or will they just continue to plump for Intel?

Running Kill-Ryzen confirmed the problem and made me think of something:

I can't overclock anything even by a really small amount on both the CPU and RAM (apart from the crucial ballistix's 2666 XMP profile) and since the CPU has its fair bit of work related to it, maybe the thing causing the problem is the faulty cpu itself?

Anyways here's the real question: has anyone of you in Europe RMA'd their CPU? Since this is my main computer I'll be stuck with a Surface 3 if I RMA and I wanted to know if there's RMA centers in Europe or if they send the CPU all the way towards America including the ETA for the whole process.

Just want to pinch in my two cents on this monitor, so I got that monitor with the bundle 64 Vega Liquid Edition and it was a upgrade kinda from a 29"" LG IPS Ultrawide to the 34"" Samsung CF791 Ultrawide Curved Monitor

My first impression on it was good god that's huge and I'm not to sure if I'm going to enjoy this curvature because I've never experienced anything like this but after a few days of owning it I started to notice how immersive this was and started to enjoy the curve

But after the first week I started to notice the issues with the monitor flashing while using the ultimate freesync setting and also was getting very bad screen tearing while using this setting. Also there were a few things about the monitor that didn't have certain settings that my previous monitor had.

There was also one other issue that I ran into with the monitor it would lose connection with display port and cycle through the other outputs trying to find a source. I found a fix to that by changing the monitor source from Auto to Manual.

Anyways I tried multiple times to fix the flickering Issue by changing the refresh rate and tried other cables but with no end to fixing it. So I've sent for a refund to Newegg because this is definitely defective and cannot justify keeping a monitor that has issues especially when it cost almost $1,000.

Amd,TrappedAtTheMall,5,5,"Research on Vega ArchitectureHi all, I have a tough question. I chose  as a topic for a research paper to write about AMD graphics cards for an engineering course, including information on the architecture and design of the cards. I thought focusing on Vega architecture would be my best bet, but I'm finding next to nothing that goes into the depth I need and am considering asking the professor for another topic. Does anyone know of any good sources for this kind of information? So far I've only been able to find whitepapers on AMDs website."

To my amazement, I did some cross comparison and I have verified that they are indeed identical. The 2M2000C4T4MF2_33/20_N and Ryzen 5 2500U share the exact same base and boost frequencies (2.0 GHz and 3.3 GHz, respectively) meaning they are one and the same. Therefore, it is logical to conclude that the Ryzen 7 2700U is very likely the other engineering sample, 2M3001C3T4MF2_33/30_N, with the significantly higher clocked base frequency (3.0 GHz).

So one of the problems I have with DP is the hot plug detect/auto detect, and I was wondering if VEGA also has this issue.

If you do not know what hot plug detect is, it's when you turn off your monitor and it disappears from windows. This will cause open windows to all go to one monitor(assuming you have more then 1 monitor setup).

Amd,pig666eon,98,10,"Lets get a few things straight about vega pricingthis is big news right now and not everyone is getting the full picture, there has been tech sites misinterpreting what was said resulting in spins on what was actually said, resulting in tech sites asking the wrong questions to amd and getting answers that has no relevance to what is going on 

lets get the facts stright

* msrp of vega is 499usd, this has not changed
* msrp of standard vega with two games is 599usd (the black pack)

what was said by gibbo over on ocuk was that the 499usd was only a launch price, why is it only a launch price? because amd have a set amount for sale at launch outside of you buying a bundle, once they are gone then you cannot buy anymore card outside of a bundle. gibbo never said that the msrp has changed what was said was that the stand alone card once sold out will be no more and if you want to buy vega you are forced to buy it in a pack, the cheapest being the black pack that comes with 2 games. so the msrp has not changed like amd have said but the issue is it will never be that price again even with new stock, resulting in any card sold from now on will be at the 599usd price point.

amd has tried to spin it as price gouging here is a few points as to why this is not the case

* the price of 599usd/550gbp/609eur is uniform across all retailers
* this price is exactly the price of the packs so if there was price gouging going on with retailers they would need to add on top of that to be classed as gouging, which is not the case in most retailers

how do we know other than ocuk and komplett saying that amd are forcing the bundles and there will be no more single card to buy outside of packs?

* the simple fact that there is zero cards listed outside of a pack, there is no listings at all for the msrp and says out of stock or pre order without the minimum of 2 ""free"" games which is considered a pack. even disregarding the 499 msrp there is zero listings on any major retailer with a single vega card on its own without having to buy it in a pack

tl;dr - the pack scandle is what is causing the price increase not gouging, retailers are forced by amd to sell them agenst the wishes of the retailers, amd are trying hard to spin it as low stock and retailers have their own pricing when its not the case"

I hear A LOT saying that on their system they struggle with 1080p@60FPS, which I find puzzling. I think the quality of the stream looks fine, when I rewatch it, but maybe im overlooking something? I have a feeling my settings are ""lower"" than they should be, to deliver this performance while streaming.

I had a 6700k before which couldn't handle streaming - it did fine, but I couldn't get it to encode at a bitrate that wouldn't make the stream buffer every few seconds. Now I have almost no dropped frames or buffering!

Why couldn't they just come out and tell us that 64 won't be faster than a 1080, however 56 beats a 1070. So if we're going to wait we should be waiting for the 56 and those who are aiming for 1080/1080ti performance should just go buy an nvidia card. If they had done that then they could've sold more silicon at higher prices as compute cards or mining cards. Makes no sense, I've been an amd fan for a really long time but this is the last time I'll allow them to let me down.

Edit: Just found out amd is locking down bios flashing. What the fuck you're not nvidia get your shit together, I was a fan because you weren't anti consumer. I guess not anymore.

But something went horrible wrong at AMD RTG it seems ... or I was too naive and expected too much technical evolution with Vega.

Will AMD really release a small Vega 11 that is probably at the same performance level at what Polaris 11/10/20 is? Then why? Just because it can have HBM2 instead of DDR5? What else feature do you might want to have with Vega 11 that is not already on Polaris? I doubt that it will be cheaper!

For me it makes no sense to produce a Vega 11 GPU when it is on the same perf level as the last generation.

As it stands, I have a video card because I have to, but I also have a mid-ATX case that's way more bulky than I need.

I want my next build to be a mini-ITX affair with 802.11 ac onboard and integrated graphics, so that 1 PCIe x16 slot can be used for whatever we come up with in the *next* five years (AR/VR comes to mind ... maybe I'll need a dGPU down the road, but I don't right now).

If the i7-8700K turns out to be a hexa-core part with significantly better IPC, I can't see buying a quad-core AMD APU, regardless of price difference. (Admittedly, I may wait for the Cannonlake part, if there's ever an LGA hexa-core released, and Ice Lake if really need be, but this is less about having more power in a vacuum than having the size rig I feel is appropriate in 2017.)

Why would AMD make such a kick-ass architecture and then say, ""but if you want graphics, you get half the cores?"" Are they waiting for 7nm to actually cut Intel off at the knees? I realize most of y'all are dGPU folks, but a lot of people do need raw CPU power with a minimal graphics load.

How will Raven Ridge be competitive in this area? (Not trolling here ... I'm honestly hoping to hear I'm totally wrong, and great chips are in the offing.)

EDIT: I thought I was clear by opening graf 2 with ""I'm not a gamer."" I'm not looking for a gaming rig. I'm looking for a powerful CPU with a passable GPU. Last I checked, that's the exact market for APUs. Yet I'm getting downvoted for continuing to say I'm not a gamer. Don't just downvote because you think I shouldn't have the needs I have."

Amd,photoblues,81,207,"Ryzen 1600X is more of an upgrade than I expected for photographyI just built a new rig yesterday. It's a 1600x on a Taichi boad with 32 gigs of DDR4 2400. It's replacing an FX-8320 that was overclocked to 8350 speeds which had 32 gigs of DDR3 1600. The video card is the same R7-265 because I'm not a gamer. I'm a photographer and some of the programs I use offload certain functions to the GPU.

I conducted a bit of a test by rendering 35 photos to tiff files from Lightroom. I then stitched them together with Autopano Giga which utilized all 12 threads. I expected it to be faster but not THIS much faster. Before when I was going to stitch a file that large I would leave it running and come back to the machine because it takes a while. Running it on the 1600x only took about 5 minutes. Also because of all the threads the CPU wasn't actually maxed out during most of that time so I was surfing the web in Firefox during the render. I'm amazed!  

I was planning on trying to overclock the ram to get the infinity fabric speed up, but I think ill leave it alone for now. 

UPDATE:

So I ran another little test that hopefully some people can glean some info from. I exported a set of photos from Lightroom 6.8 of a wedding I shot a few years ago. It was 483 photos exported as jpeg at 100% quality with the lens correction on. These are all raw files shot with a a Canon 7d (18 megapixels). I timed the export process at 24 minutes and 14 seconds as timed with me and my phone. Here is a screenshot of the task manager about halfway though to show how the threads were being utilized: http://imgur.com/gqiBJoz

The cpu utilization was fluctuating between about 20% and 90%. P: is the drive containing the raw files and E: is the drive they are being exported to. I don't remember how long something like this used to take on my old rig (long story) but it was absolutely much longer than 24 minutes. I was also streaming music with Spotify and surfing the web in Firefox with just short of a grillion tabs open while it was running.

After putting together a pclos linux box for a friend I ran some benchmarks to compare with my previous Athlon X4 845 build.

SPPEED KINGS: AMD VERSIS PENTIRUM 4; raw results: http://browser.geekbench.com/geekbench3/compare/6273776?baseline=8408049 

If it were not for the AES category weighing in very negatively on the older CPU, the Pentium score would not be as bad as it appears above.


Adjusted results:

 The Athlon has a slight clock advantage (3.8 ST / 3.5 MT versus 3.4) and core advantage (4 versus 2), so I have a third column P4** which multiplies the Pentium score to offset for handicap, by a factor of 112% and 224% = 1.12*200% in the relevant categories.


Integer Single-thread (ST) 

XV=2917   P4=1260   P4**=1408


Integer Multi-thread (MT): 

XV=10367   P4=2468   P4**=5517


FPU ST:

XV=2254   P4=885   P4**=989


FPU MT:

XV=7497   P4=1764   P4**=3943


My conclusion is that excavator has about twice the IPC of the Pentium D.

The above four scores make up a summary of composites. It's also interesting to browse and see how the different architectures performed on the specific tasks, in the geekbench compare link above. "

Amd,andro7star,27,23,"Optimising Ryzen CPU &amp; Memory Clocks for better Stability and Overclocking (Gaming)The Optimisations discussed below are best for gaming only. As it essentially sacrifices memory performance to offload the CPU's memory controller, thereby allowing higher CPU clocks.

Over the course of the past week, I've realised a few bios-level tweaks that have improved my CPU OC by 75-100MHz at the same voltage. This is thanks to the memory-tuning Blog that AMD released, earlier. https://community.amd.com/community/gaming/blog/2017/07/14/memory-oc-showdown-frequency-vs-memory-timings

Yep, tuning my memory settings allowed me to achieve higher CPU clocks! i.e. better gaming-performance at the cost of application-performance.



Here are my computer's specifications:

* CPU: Ryzen 7 1700x + (Cooler) Arctic Freezer Xtreme Rev. 2 (AM4)
* Motherboard: Gigabyte AB350 Gaming 3 ATX F7 AGESA 1.0.0.6 
* Ram: 4x4GB SR Crucial Ballistix Sport LT (Micron Die) @2400MHz



Let me start by listing my best OC (pre-optimisation)



Best OC Before Optimisation (Stable):

* CPU Clock: 3.8GHz
* Vcore: 1.356V
* Memory Clock: 2400MHz 16-16-16-39-2T
* Vdram: 1.200V
* VSoc: Auto (~0.900V)



After a little tweaking, here's how I managed get 100MHz OC extra at the same voltage:



Tweaked Memory Options:

* Geardown Mode (GDM): Off (major effect on cpu)
* BankGroupSwap (BGS): Off (major effect on cpu; should only be toggled with Single Rank memory*)
* RankInterleaving: auto (left on default, untested; should only be toggled with Dual Rank Memory* )
* Memory Clock: 3200MHz (no effect on cpu)
* Timings: tuned (affects memory stability only)
* Command Rate: 2T (affects memory stability only)
* Vdram: 1.350V



Tweaked CPU Options:

* SVM: off (negligible effect)
* IOMMU: off (minor effect)
* SMT: off (major effect. Not recommended if you utilise hyper threading or have ryzen 5)
* AMD Cool &amp; quiet: default (affects power efficiency. Negligible effect) (you can turn it off)
* GLOBAL C-state control: default (affects power efficiency. Minor effect on cpu if you turn it off)



Best OC After Optimisation (Stable):

* CPU Clock: 3.9GHz
* Vcore: 1.356V
* Memory Clock: 3200MHz 18-20-20-41-2T
* Vdram: 1.350V (actual 1.38V)
* VSoc: Auto (~1.100V)


So by tweaking these options... I was able to add on to my CPU multiplier, and get a better OC than my previous one, at the same voltage!

These tweaks are primarily for gaming. Do not sacrifice memory performance if you require it for other applications. Do not sacrifice hyperthreading, especially if you have Ryzen 5 or require it outside of gaming.

(!) Sacrificing hyper threading gave me stability and 25mhz extra.

If single core performance is what you need... Here's an unrecommended CPU Tweak (Ryzen 7 Only):

* Core Count: 4+0 (Major Effect on Cpu Core clocks +50MHz OC possible) (you are disabling 4 cores!)

This is my personal experience. These tweaks are most probably specific to the config I have. It all depends on one's motherboard. What worked for someone might not work for everyone. I only wish to share and discuss what I have found here.

Share your clocks if these tweaks helped your OC!

Or tell me how useless they were for you...

Edit: shitty formating (I'm on mobile).

*Edit 2: thanks, u/rygb24 for the clarity on GDM and rank interleaving in the context of SR and DR.

Edit 3: These Optimisations are best for single-core performance maximisation."

But why is HBM2 required to do so? It feels like AMD could have kept the HBM2 to the FE card, and perhaps its top end RX Vega. Why not continue using gddr5, or even try out the gddr5x?

I just don't understand the point of HBM. If the performance isn't there, if the power draw is still classic AMD, then why do people need HBM in a card that is 1080 equivalent?


edit: Thanks for all the replies! So basically I understood that HBM represents the future of GPU memory with its many benefits over GDDR. I was curious what others thought it terms of current hardware, and why they thought RX Vega *needed* the HBM.

When I try to install/reinstall them again Steam gives me a disk write error box. (side note I see disk usage at constant 100% when trying to install them). I've run chkdsk, CrystalDiskInfo and disk management, they say it's in Good health.

*edit* Not sure if relevant, but I have 4 drives, 1 m.2 which I'm using now, 1 ssd where my old Windows is installed (with Intel), 2 hdds (one which is giving me problems).

Also, programs are just very slow that are installed there.

Edit 2: I think i fixed it by reinstalling windows with just the main hard drive connected. Then I replaced the sata cable on the problem hard drive."

Amd,vahandr,1,1,Question about overclocking RAMI recently built my first system with a Ryzen 5 1600 which I overlocked to 3.7Ghz. I have Corsair DIMM 16GB DDR4-2400 RAM. Would it be beneficial to increase the RAM speed from 2400MHz to a higher value (if it's stable)? I really don't know a lot about RAM overclocking and how it works with Ryzen so it would be awesome if somebody could explain it to me!

Amd,doragaes,158,47,"Likely Improvements to Zen 2?I've been pouring over the AT EPYC results and thinking about the likely kinds of small tweaks to the core (and especially the interconnects) that could be made to 'fix' some of the problems that cause it to lag behind Sky Lake-SP.  The assumption, I think, is that chances to the execution-end of the core will be relatively small.  

First off, it'd be useful to understand the things Zen is strong at:

*  SMT (8% lead over Intel in SMT benefit) - but may represent a tradeoff with branch prediction (ie, Zen is worse at branch prediction and therefore benefits more from SMT as there are more stalled cycles to get back)
* Legendary 128-bit FPU performance - this result was really surprising given Intel's persistent FPU lead for... pretty much ever.  
* Small die strategy FTW (I think it's fair to say AMD's decision not to pursue a monolithic die is completely and stunningly vindicated)
* Near core latency wins!  For the first time since I can remember AMD has cache supremacy over Intel.  
* 8 channels DDR4 is a pretty big advantage.  Expect Intel to wipe this out within a generation, so it's going to be very important to tweak the cache system to fix the mid-tier latency gap.  It'd be great to see AMD move to 12 channels, but I don't think this is in the cards for Zen 2.  The pin count of the LGA would be hilarious.  

Some quick improvements:

The general idea is to shore up the areas where the inter-die penalties hamper the platform's ability to effectively manage workloads that are sharing resources across the chip.  

* Let's have another couple cores per CCX - each Zen die goes to 12 cores (from 8).  This means a 4-die ""Naples 2"" chip has 48 cores and 96 threads (from 32/64).  Maybe a stretch goal is 16 cores (but I feel like there are other productive things to be added to the core, and this might cause problems for the IF in terms of saturating interdie bandwidth).  Probably the single most important thing for AMD to do is to keep the core pressure up on Intel.  They're already behind (stuck at 28 cores on Skylake-SP).  Intel's going to continue to struggle to balance their ridiculous mesh interconnect with yields and process transition.  Put the boot on their neck.  If AMD executes Zen2 well, they could actually take majority share of the server market within 3 years.  The only real advantage Intel has is AVX512, and once AMD wipes out their market leadership AMD can start implementing the ISA changes they want (which are usually smarter than Intel's - eg FMA4 v. FMA3).  
* Is it possible AMD could increase the number of dice on the [package to 5](http://i.imgur.com/hxvmQTG.png)?  I've been thinking about ways this could work without absolutely killing their latency numbers.  An additional IF linksper core?  This would be massive, as every additional core adds 5 to the package.  You can still build 4-die MCM's if you want, but it would create a 60-core chip.  Sorry about your power bill...  
* Maybe an extra ALU to run up the score on Zen's epyc (see what I did there) fixed point benchmark wins.  Some workloads really are that simple.  
* Transition from a quad 128 dual 256 FPU to a quad 256 dual 512 (or perhaps a quad 128, dual, solo 512) FPU.  You could probably make the argument that Zen is competitive enough in FPU throughput that they don't need to add AVX 512 just yet (plus the thermal penalties, and the 512 FPU is like adding an entire second FPU 'core' to Zen).  An interesting solution would be to widen the front-end and then build a fixed-function 512-bit FPU (ie, it doesn't do the splitting magic that Intel's FPU's do) and retaining Zen's current dual 256 FPU's.  The simpler wide FPU would be easier to implement and power, and would retain the flexibility of the smaller, narrower 128/256 pipes.  ""We support AVX512, but we keep the simplicity of the old ways"".  Minimize the die and thermal impact of implementing AVX512, but also get the benefit of having it.    Part of the issue of AVX512 appears to be that Intel is having to scale the clock of a core running AVX512 *waaaay* down to manage the thermal impact of the vector unit.  I wonder if there's a percentage in doing a heterogenous approach where only some cores have an 512-bit FPU, or just pushing it altogether - Intel claims big efficiency gains but if it comes at the cost of running all other parallel code 30% slower...is that worth it?  
* Boost the front end execution caches across the board to parity with Sky Lake-SP.  
* Upgrade PCIe links to 4.0 (instant doubling of inter-socket and off-chip bandwidth, huge increase in I/O bandwidth).  Spec was just finalized, so it's possible AMD had a bus master in development for Zen 2.  
* Increase L3 to 32-64 MB, perhaps re-architect it into monolithic L3 for each die (reducing penalty for hopping from one side of the CCX to the other) (the big ""latency penalty"" that Zen experiences over Skylake is in this memory access range - it's at parity in L1, L2 and main memory - boosting this would solve this problem).  That said, AMD reports that the intercore L3 penalty for chips on the same CCX is near-zero, so maybe you want to keep the split model if it boosts yields.  I worry that this saturates the on-chip IF bandwidth with cache requests, though).  It sounds like yields are exceeding even AMD's expectations - so perhaps cut down on the redundancy in the cache a bit (and use the die shrink) to facilitate this.  
* Infinity Fabric:  Little is known about the 'inside' of IF, but it really looks as though it is a standard HT 3.1 link with the cache coherency sauce that AMD developed in the Opteron days baked on top.  HT was pretty advanced for its time, and the 3.1 link was a 32-bit 3.2 GHz affair - so fast it makes me wonder if AMD isn't already doing a 64-bit 1.6 GHz variant instead.  At any rate, boosting the IF/HT link speed (freq and bit width) would be in order.  I'm not any kind of knowledgeable on interconnect managers, but I wonder if there's something they can do in terms of sophistication of the 'switch' structure that sits atop the HT link to reduce latency/make small data requests process faster and more efficiently.  It sounds like there's a lot of partitioning of the links possible for power management, developing this feature to support partitioning for shuttling huge numbers of small packets could be beneficial (scheduling transfers to use the width of the bus more efficiently, essentially).  
* Build in an extra IF port on each die, so that you can attach accelerators to the IF directly (and can sell a machine learning chip for ridiculous prices).  

EDIT:  The more I think about it, the more interesting the AVX-512 and Intel Lace(TM) Topology are as design questions.  It almost looks like, in their Hubris, Intel bet so heavily on their manufacturing prowess that they didn't consider AMD's small die strategy (which had failed in the GPU realm) could compete.  And it does.  Hence the ""glued together"" nonsense.  I hope AT puts together more articles on this.  It's a great time to be a tech hobbyist.

Amd,NorthStarZero,4,3,"Notes on my new Ryzen 1700X buildCPU: Ryzen 1700x  
Motherbaord: Gigabyte GA-AB350M-DH3  
RAM: Corsair Vengeance CMK16GX4M2B3200C16  
Case: Thermaltake V21  
CPU Cooler: Noctua DH15  
GFX: Sapphire Tri-X R9 Fury OC  
SSD: Not here yet (will be an M.2)  
Power: Corsair HX 750  

So most of the parts showed up, less the SSD, so I built it last night. I put in an old laptop HD (that I had swapped for an SSD) that had Windows 10 on it, and I'll be damned if the sucker didn't boot right up.

Changed the BIOS to the latest version which added a ton of memory options.

Scrubbed all the old Intel/NVidia crap off the HD and installed the AMD chipset and gfx drivers. That poor old HD got *pounded* between my filesystem cleanup and all the Windows updates,

Man alive, I forgot how slow SATA II 3 Gb/sec really is. It feels like this is a 2005-era machine without the SSD.

The Noctua CPU cooler fits, but they engineered it to the millimetre. You can't fit a pencil between the cooling fins and the gfx card - but it doesn't touch either.

200mm fan on the front of the case, 140mm fan on the rear, 2 x 140mm fans on the top, 2 monster fans on the cooler, 3 monster fans on the gfx card - and the machine is practically *silent*. Modern fan management is amazing.

Machine occasionally refused to recognise the USB keyboard to get into the BIOS, so I plugged in an old PS/2 keyboard for the short term.

Activated XMP memory profile and set to 3200 MHz. Power cycled 5 times then self-reset BIOS and booted at 2133 (nice feature). Same thing at 3000. Same thing at 2600. Booted at 2400. Tried manually setting timings for 3200 - machine powered up, ran fans, and sat there. Several power cycles, same deal. Shorted CMOS_CLR jumper and it came back. Set to 2400 and ordered some G.Skill FlareX. Some folks have gotten the Corsair RAM to work at 3200, but I guess I'm not one of them.

Playing with BIOS settings sucks when you have to boot off a slow-ass HD.

Ran UserBenchmark (which isn't the most demanding benchmark, but provides results distributions, which is handy.) CPU slightly better than median. GPU right on median. RAM has 2 ""humps"" in the distribution - one probably 2133, the other 3200. I'm slightly better than median on the slow hump, but worse than mean for overall RAM speed.

Coil whine during the gfx portion of the benchmark! I've never heard that before!   

Updated World of Tanks to HD client. Turned all settings to max. 120 FPS - booyah! And *pretty*! No coil whine during the game and fans barely turning. Awww yisss....

Tomb Raider benchmark, all settings max + TressFX, 150 FPS, no coil whine, fans idling.

Holy shit, is it 0200? It is! OK, time to stop for now.

TODO:

* install SSD when it shows up and do a clean install of Windows on it (ugh - so much software to install)

* Maybe play with RAM timings a little more until the FlareX shows up

* Try a processor OC and see what it gets me

* more benchmarks, including a Vegas video render (which is the whole point of this build)"
Amd,ThisIsAnuStart,2,7,"RX480 to RX580 conversion - Impressive results, and no more custom bios patch!I was browsing through OC.net and stumbled on a thread to convert the Sapphire 1342mhz Nitro+, to a Sapphire 580 Pulse, so I decided to give it a flash, see what the difference was, and I am immensely impressed with the results so far. I don't have much testing on the limits yet, but I can list the difference I have found so far.

RX480 Nitro+ bios, with custom bios to have extra memory strap as well as lifted the power limit.

- 1425mhz @ 1.236v
- Memory 2085mhz max without errors (I have a bad memory chip so it won't OC well anymore)
- Max temp 60c under 2x synthetics at the same time
- VRM temp 88c under same load



RX580 Pulse bios, unrestricted power limit

- 1425mhz @ 1.175v
- Memory 2185mhz max without errors (I have a bad memory chip so it won't OC well anymore)
- Max temp 52c under 2x synthetics at the same time
- VRM temp 69c under same load


This was done on the fly, no real big testing was done other than multiple hours of gaming, and stress testing / benchmarks. I plan on overclocking higher with these stock voltages, as I know I have a very very good core, as with the launch bios (with wattool mods), I was able to sustain 1580mhz @ 1.36v for a series of tests, as well as game, but power was a bit insane, running at ~330W according to stats, VRM temps were also at a toasty 101c peak during these tests.

Of course this was done under a full cover block.

I will investigate further, try to get a little more out at the stock voltage (1.150v with a 25mv offset from bios), memory is my biggest challenge, as when I was running this card under a universal water block, one of the memory heatsink fell, and the ambient air wasn't enough to stop that chip from basically cooking itself, of course I was dabbling with 2300+ mhz memory when this happened.

I will post proofs for the upgrade later on, and encourage anybody else with converted cards to share their results also!

Amd,TxDrumsticks,86,61,"A Look at Vega Year/Year improvements compared to old AMD flagshipsA lot of people have talked back and forth about whether or not Vega is acceptable as a 1080 competitor, as a 1080 Ti competitor, etc. etc. Some people think that competing with the 1080 is good enough, others think it's unacceptable.


&amp;nbsp;



I wanted to go back and check on AMD's previous flagship models, both from a flagship to flagship perspective, and a year to year performance improvement perspective, and see just what AMD (and by broad generalization, Nvidia) has accomplished in the past with new generations of tech. I figure this is one of the best/most objective ways to analyze Vega. If AMD can come closer to their previous improvements (particularly the successful ones), it bodes well for Vega. So, here is what I'm looking at:

- The HD 4870, which launched in [June 2008](http://www.adtech.com/show/2556)
- The HD 5870, which launched in [September 2009](http://www.adtech.com/show/2841)
- The HD 6970, which launched in [December 2010](http://www.adtech.com/show/4061/amds-radeon-hd-6970-radeon-hd-6950)
- The HD 7970, which launched in [December 2011](http://www.adtech.com/show/5261/amd-radeon-hd-7970-review/)
- The R9 290X, which launched in [October 2013](http://www.adtech.com/show/7457/the-radeon-r9-290x-review/)
- The R9 Fury X, which launched in [July 2015](http://www.adtech.com/show/9390/the-amd-radeon-r9-fury-x-review)
- Vega, which will be launching in July 2017.

As an aside, all of these articles from Adtech are very interesting and worth reading from a historical perspective. They give quite a bit of historical background on the GPU landscape today and how it developed, and they are extremely well written. 


&amp;nbsp;



For performance comparisons, I'm going to use Techpowerup. They may or may not have what people accept as the best set of games to benchmark, but they have fantastic charts that make it easy to discern the performance gains card to card. So, here we go:

Card|Process|Architecture Change?|Time Lapse|Performance Gain Over Prior|

I used techpowerup 1080p because it's the most common monitor used by people. At this point, 4k is becoming relevant too, but I don't have a list of 4k benches from the Fury X to Vega.

There are a couple of things that jump out at me:

- The time between AMD flagships lengthened considerably. Ironically, the fastest turnaround was on both a major architectural change *and* a process node switch to the HD 7970. 

- We can see why the HD 5870 was unrivaled. A 63% performance boost gen to gen is positively huge, and it put AMD on top for quite a while. 

- The 7970 posts a 28% gain, but is well known as a phenomenal overclocker. If I remember, 20%+ overclocks were not uncommon. 

- The 6970 was a particularly weak followup to the HD 5870. Note that it essentially was near the GTX 570, Nvidia's second best card. 

- With each of these releases, except for the HD 6970 (which was maybe 15%), AMD was within 10% of Nvidia's best, if not succeeding it. With Vega, we're looking at a 20%+ deficit, if I'm not mistaken. 

- With each of these releases, AMD was either ahead or close behind in power efficiency. With Vega, they seem to be behind by nearly 2x. 

- With each previous node change, AMD delivered huge improvements. The 5870 speaks for itself, and the 7970 was a great overclocked. I don't personally find Vega standing tall next to those two cards, and the finfet change is practically a double node improvement.

- AMD accomplished its performance gains on 28nm by abandoning their small die strategy. It gave them powerful cards, but also helped put them in the power consumption area they are now. 

&amp;nbsp;



It was hard for me to estimate Vega's boost over the Fury X; with games *all over the place*, there's a wide range of what's possible. We'll see in the future what it falls out to, but it seems to be something like 15% to 30% at the moment? If somebody disputes these numbers please just let me know, source a proper set of numbers, and I'll happily change it. 


&amp;nbsp;



I personally don't find equaling the 1080 good enough. With an architecture switch AND a process switch (keep in mind, the 14nm process switch was much better than going from 55nm to 40nm, or 40nm to 28nm too), AMD should have delivered more than what Vega appears to be. The finfet node transition was effectively the equivalent of a double node change; that's why Nvidia delivered the gains they did, and it's something that put AMD in the hole. There is of course the chance that RX Vega has some magic bullet available, but given the demo today (freesync vs gsync, no numbers), I don't see anything more impressive coming out of their hat. 


&amp;nbsp;


I hope that Vega is better than what we've seen so far, but from a numbers perspective, if it isn't, Vega is not good enough. Effectively a double node change, and what should be the biggest architecture revision in 5 years, should have pushed AMD much further than it did. 


&amp;nbsp;



From a design engineer's standpoint, I think AMD should have seen this coming far in advance. Most teams have some kind of performance modeling that happens before a product even goes into its initial tape-in. AMD should have known that they were looking at this level of performance for a long time, so I really don't know what happened. Maybe there's a core flaw in the silicon, or maybe there's some critical issue with the software, but I don't buy that it can be dismissed purely because Nvidia has more money than AMD, because we've seen *AMD* do better.

My understanding is that this lower bit reduces power consumption.  But it also massively compromises compute performance.  How will they meet the needs of those who need hardcore compute performance?

Is gimping AVX the reason Ryzen seems so much more power efficient than Intel?  If so, seems like no trick at all.

Maybe Zen2 will provide the option to natively outsource the compute to the GPU somehow instead of using AVX?  That would be quite the innovation if they can figure that out.  Power efficiency and superior compute performance.

The 1400 is at a comfortable 3.8 @ 1.35mv. I can't pull voltage anymore. It will crash after 20-30 minutes on prime95. The processor idles at 30-32 Celsius. Under synthetic load it'll hit as high as 60-63 Celsius after an hour. Under two + hours of gaming load it doesn't go past 52-53 Celsius. 

The CPU cooler is the cooler Master 212 that has two fans. Forget what it's called. 

The ram is at 3000mhz but I can't get it past auto on bios. I was able to clock it correctly in ryzen master. Go figure. 

Anywho, the 1400 is very strong for it's price and happy with it's value!

I'm planning to upgrade my i5 system to Ryzen at the end of this month / early next, and I've decided on getting a ryzen 1700 and an Asus crosshair VI Hero because of a really nice promotion I found on that specific bundle/combo.

My problem is that I'm undecided on what RAM kit I should get... I know ryzen loves RAM frequency thanks to it's infinity fabric, but how about cas frequency?

How big of a performance hit will I get by choosing a 3200 MHz CL 16 (hynix kit) vs a 3200 MHz CL 14 (Samsung b-die kit)? Is it really a big hit that warrants the extra 60€ investment? Or are they basically the same?

The kits I found good for my build were:

- 16GB G.Skill Trident Z RGB DDR4-3200 CL14 (2x8GB) = 202.66€
- 16GB Corsair Vengeance red LED DDR4-3200 CL16 (2x8GB) = 146.93€

I'm doing a black / red theme build, so that is why my choices are a bit limited. However, that doesn't mean I can't accept suggestions... :)

Also, I know Aura sync software sometimes corrupts RGB ram sticks, is there any news about a fix? Am I fine if I don't change the colors of the dimms using the software?

Please leave a comment below. Thanks. :)

**EDIT:** After giving some serious thought and listening to your thoughts, I don't think the price difference is worth it. I'll jump the gun with the cheaper kit, and see if I'm lucky. If not I'll wait for better memory support and hope one day it will reach the advertised speeds. Thanks all!

Amd,AeliteStoner,7,1,"Questions regarding current state of Ryzen ecosystemI'm about to embark on the construction of a new PC build based on a Ryzen CPU. Use cases cover gaming, coding, audio editing, music production and possibly video editing.

My first question is how many of the initial concerns about the Ryzen platform, particularly performance, have been fixed to date, both low and high level? Should I wait for the next batch of hardware?

Second question is about overclocking. I have never overclocked a system in my life and I'm sort of scared of the idea, that's why I'll most likely gravitate towards the X-suffixed models. But using a Ryzen CPU overclocking at least the RAM to hit at least 3.2 GHz is a must to get the best performance. If i use RAM sticks rated at 3.2 GHz bus clock, could I go beyond that? Also, how easy is it to reach turbo frequencies for the X-suffixed models?

Amd,proudsikh,14,7,"Ryzen 1700x/1800x and 1080 GTXHey Red Squad,

I'm finally glad to be going back to AMD. My history has been great with AMD but I went with haswell in my last build from a quad core black edition to see if Intel changed at all. Well 2 defective cpus later and frustrating black screens, I'm glad that Ryzen is out. 

I am looking into getting a ryzen 1700x or 1800x and will be using my current 1080 ftw edition. I am going to definitely overclock either CPU so I'll be getting vengeance 3200mhz RAM for sure. 

The reason I'm posting this is, for those who have this configuration, did you notice an improvement that was obvious? Windows is normally using 7-11% CPU randomly and I also have chrome, discord, and task manager open. If I'm playing PUBG or OW, I can get 144fps easy, but my CPU will hit 90% easily and then sometime I'll get spikes to 100% because of Windows. 

So my question is for those who have this setup and game @ 144hz in 1080 or 1440p, what does your CPU usage look like? I am excited and I'm so close to pulling the trigger but this is the only thing I'm curious about before I just pull the trigger. 

Thanks for reading guys!

Amd,Flying-Artichoke,24,6,"1700 gets stuck at 1.5 GhzRecently switched to a 1700, MSI x370 Pro Carbon and 2x8gb Gskill tridentz 3200 and its been going great so far.  
  
This is the first CPU I've had that I can OC so I've been wanting to try my hand at it even though I still have the stock cooler, people have been saying they can still do quite a bit with it. So, over the last few days I've been slowly bumping up from 3.0 ghz and running some benchmarks, stress test and just using everything as normal. So far Ive been able to push to 3.8 with the voltage set to auto and CPUZ is reporting 1.216, I believe.  
  
The problem comes up when I try to go to 3.9, it boots but CPUZ says its stuck at 1.5ghz and the benchs and stess test definitely line up with that. I tried giving it a bit more voltage, went up slowly from 1.21 --&gt; 1.25 -- 1.28 and then finally 1.3 and no matter what, it just stays at 1.5ghz. Anybody have any tips for a novice or insight as to whats happening?  
  
Edit: Thanks for the tips everyone, Looks like it is a bug with MSI. I was able to use Ryzen master to OC to 4.0 @ 1.4v and it seemed stable for the ~30 mins of CPUz stress test I did. Probably won't keep it there since I'm still using the stock cooler and should double check that that's within my PSU spec."

Amd,T3chHippie,26,13,"What's the deal with RAM timings?I still consider myself a mediocre PC builder and mostly due to not knowing all these fine details about parts. I watched a tech quickie video on timings, but it really didn't explain what I wanted to know. I got a 1600 coming but I'm still waiting on sales for RAM and MOBO. But I'm having a difficult time with the RAM. 
  
  I'll use this timing for example. 
  
  16-18-18-36 (Corsairs 3200 LED RAM timings) 
  
  I know 16 is the CAS latency. But what do the rest ""matter"" 
  Do I want the next two numbers in the series to be as close to the first as I can, or higher than it? How about the last one?
  
  I've seen some RAM with ""tighter"" timings (if I understand that term correctly) at 15-16-16-35 at 3000, and some fairly 'loose' ones at 16-18-18-38 at 3000. Same RAM (Tridentz RGB 16Gb), different ""model #s"" but the 16CL is cheaper than the 15CL by a little bit. 
  
   I guess I'm asking, does it REALLY matter what the timings are aside from the CL? Are the rest of them adjustable in BIOS anyway? 
  
  And lastly, since 3200 is only a few bucks more than 3000, should I try to get 3200 just in case it's more easily supported in the future? Sorry if this is a NOOB question, I've just never fully understood RAM timings and since Ryzen is picky about that kind of thing, I wanna know as much as I can. "

Amd,mysacisanorange,14,2,"Reference R9 290 fan mod?Due to the low prices of reference 290's (and the weirdly high prices of non-reference models), I was thinking of picking up a 290.

I know noise and heat is a huge concern. Just wondering, could I take off the front plate, and then attach case fans onto the heatsink (while keeping the blower fan on the card), to reduce temperatures? I know without the front cover, the blower design won't work. But the blower fan can cool what is right below it, and a case fan or two can chill the heatsink better than the stock fan, right?

http://www.legitreviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/radeon-290x-hsf.jpg

basically, just strapping a high quality fan to the heatsink.

Any opinions? 

edit: I know cutting a piece out of the front cover, and then mounting a fan to it might be the best option. However, I would like this to be reversible. Although I would see it working really well, especially if I have no good way to mount the fan. "

Then upgrade when Ryzen 2 causes a price drop and/or more 2nd hand offers of the 1st gen.

Amd,AkataD,144,101,"AMD Price ranges vs Nvidia in different countriesI recently-ish subbed to this subreddit because I'm eagerly waiting for Vega and this is how I stay up-to-date with all the news, and because I was in the process of buying a RX 580 and didn't know which one to choose. I have since bought a Gigabyte aorus 580 4GB and have sent it yesterday in exchange for a aorus 580 8GB model. The 580's role is mainly as a placeholder until Vega.

And this brings me to my main point. I'm curious how the prices variate between countries. I've seen a lot of discussions here where people were saying there's no point in choosing a 580 over a 480, or just paying an extra 50-100$ for a generic 1070 is a lot better. 

I have checked the prices on Amazon and americans are right. One of the best RX 580 (the sapphire nitro+ clocked at 1450mhz) is priced at 315$ while a cheap gtx 1070 (gigabyte windforce OC 8GB) is 375$. Obviously, the 1070 is in another performance bracket and is overall a lot better, and it's justifiable to ask someone to save up 2 more weeks and pay an extra 60$.

HOWEVER, in Europe, Romania, the story is quite different. On average everything in Europe is more expensive than in the US, but take a look a the prices. I'll just give you the equivalent in dollars to make it easier. 

Sapphire Radeon RX 580 Nitro+ Limited Edition 8GB (imo the best 580 out there) - 331$.

Gigabyte GeForce GTX 1070 WINDFORCE OC 8GB (average pricer) - 530$. 

MSI GeForce GTX 1070 Sea Hawk X 8GB (most expensive) - 625$

The absolute cheapest 1070 I could find was: Palit GeForce GTX 1070 Dual 8GB at - 454$ (on discount).

As you can see, there's a much wider gap between a 580 and a 1070. Even the 1060 is on average more expensive here. With the Gigabyte Aorus GeForce GTX 1060 Xtreme Edition 9Gbps coming in at 416$, and a generic non-OC one around 343$. 
Also, for some reason the high-end 480's are priced a bit higher than the 580's, so there's no reason to choose a 480 over a 580.

Simply put, my country is AMD land since they are priced so much better.
What are the price ranges in your country?


**EDIT** : It seems there's a common theme in Europe. The 1070 is priced much higher than the 580 compared to the US where the difference is 50-100$. It's consistently at least 100+$ more expensive. Why tho? 
Also props to AMD for having more even prices all-round the world :) "

Now that AMD announced Threadripper (awesome name btw) I'm unsure again. 

My usage is mostly gaming, some rendering and and streaming, got alot of applications and tabs running togheter with a game or two simultaneously. I would like my rig to be somewhat future proof, whatever that is, hopefully viable the coming 5-6 years. 

What are your expectations on Threadripper, will the IPC be equal to Ryzen? Will it overclock equally good or less? Will the potential heat of 10-12-14-16 cores limit the CPU (as with 6950X)? 

And the final question, is it worth to replace a 6950X?

It looks like Naples now known as EPYC is AMD's true crown jewel, their true flagship product. Ryzen and Vega are merely complementing EPYC. Their success isn't even the most important thing for AMD. It looks like Intel will be caught with its pants down once these chips launch. I expect them be the outright performance leader instead of just price/performance, and that too by some distance.

Can we expect AMD to gain 20-30% market share within 1 year of EPYC's launch? That's several billion dollars, AMD could probably triple their revenues through this apparently revolutionary product."

- Won't be overclocking
- Prefer Quiet + low heat 

I originally went with the 580 and have considered maybe dropping down to a 570 to save some money, if the 580 would be overkill. I don't see myself upgrading for another 5-6 years at which time maybe 4k gaming will be within reach. From what i can tell the 570 would provide excellent performance gaming at 1080, but would it be viable to run a game like elite: dangerous in VR at a decent resolution &amp; frame rate?

One last thing, I am new to AMD and know nothing about VEGA. Should I hold out for it? Will they have a line of cards at the current 570 &amp; 580 price range?

So, I finally had some free time over the weekend to get my builds straightened up. My old 8350 build, I cleaned, refreshed and reinstalled everything. This went off without a hitch.

My 1700 build not so much:

* 1700X @ Auto
* Asus CH6 @ 1002 BIOS
* 2 x 16GB Trident Z 3200 (14-14-14-34) @ 2100
* Corsair H110i AIO cooler
* Windows 10 Pro (Up to date as of 04/18/17)
* EVGA 970GTX SSC
* Corsair Carbide 540 Case
* EVGA 750 B2 power supply

This has been the most frustrating build since the old Athlon days of the early 2000s. I have several problems, and I was hoping to post them here; instead of posting in each individual subreddit. I may do this later, if it warrants it.

My problems:

1. My 1700X bounces between 1.42v and 1.51v. This is at 3400MHz with no overclocking, not even DOCP1. This seems rather high, is this normal?
1. I can't get the memory to post above 2100MHz. I am not terribly worried about that issue right now.
1. Boot up seems rather slow, taking anywhere from 30 seconds to 90 seconds.
1. Corsair Link 4 does not really controls my fans, at least the way I want them. So, I uninstalled it and tried using SIV64 (it reports the offsets correctly)-- but I can get anywhere with it. My AIO fans are running at 2300rpm and they are too noisy for my tastes.
1. Secure boot is not enabled?

My biggest issue is the cooling right now, I need to setup the H110i again. I followed the instructions, but the unit was not listed among my devices. Right now everything is hooked up as suggested, except that I've disconnected the USB control cable since I don't have CL4 installed. Should I readjust where the fans and pump are hooked up?

Can anyone recommend an easier program to control my fans that has a correct offset temperature for 1700X?

My CH6 has several ATX power 20+4 pin, an 8 pin(4+4) and finally another 4pin connector. The first two are connected, should the 3rd be as well.

I'm really sorry that this is a 'dumpy' kind of post, but I've been building PCs for myself and others since 1997, and I am flummoxed. 

I need help.

Amd,p4block,2,8,"The hunt for 580 and 570 VBIOSesThese cards do have a trick up in their silicon sleeve although purely software based. They include a new memory middle power state between idle (300MHz) and full (2000MHz) that allows them to draw a lot less during heavy desktop workloads, watching videos, or just driving high resolution or refresh rate displays.

The good old trick of flashing the old card with the same PCB should work. Higher ootb clocks and lower power consumption, plus you get a 5 instead of a 4 in GPU-Z. 

That said, the current VBIOS database in Techpowerup for the 580 is rather low (just new Nitro+ models).

For all the people that happen to lay their hands on a new card, please upload the VBIOS with GPU-Z so the upgrades are available for all. You will need the latest version that [JUST got updated](https://www.techpowerup.com/download/techpowerup-gpu-z/) :D

Amd,firagabird,3,0,"The RX 500 series may be the value king of 4GB GPUs**UPDATE**: After browsing the vendor sites, only Sapphire seems to be offering the 8GHz mem clock; everyone else (MSI, GB, PC) has it at 7GHz. Learning this, I no longer think the 580 4GB is hot stuff.

**OG Post (w/ redactions)**: a lot of the spotlight seems to be trained on the RX 580 8GB, and for good reason; it is the ""flagship"" of the new RX 500 series. The opinions on it are decidedly mixed, mostly because it seems to guzzle electricity to achieve minimal gains over the RX 480 it's meant to replace.

However, not much has been said of its smaller, but IMO much feistier siblings, the RX 570 ~~and expecially the RX 580 **4GB**~~. I just wanted to make a quick note on each, because I feel that these cards may be the unsung heroes of the 500 series:

* **RX 570** - as opposed to the 580, this card is a straight up better card vs. the outgoing RX 470, no strings attached. Based off the TechReport review, it has higher clocks on both core and memory, performance that nips at the heels of the 480, and barely uses any extra power (~5W) to do so. TechReport's famous perf/$ scatter plot ([link](https://techreport.com/r.x/2017_04_18_AMD_s_Radeon_RX_580_and_Radeon_RX_570_graphics_cards_a_quick_look/99thvalue.png)) makes it obvious.
* ~~**RX 580 4GB** - I haven't seen any reviewer testing this card, and I speculate that it's because it would absolutely steal all of the (what little) thunder from the 8GB version, because aside from the reduced capacity, this card has an *identical* memory clock (e.g. [Sappire Nitro](http://sapphirenitro.sapphiretech.com/en/580-4.html#specifications)). That means, for practically any game played at sane quality settings, the RX 580 4GB will have the same exact performance as its 8GB brother for ~$30 cheaper.~~

Although the RX 580 8GB has left a bittersweet aftertaste on the entire series (kind of like a reverse halo effect; a devil's horns effect?) I feel that the bigger deal is going to be the two aforementioned cards. Anyone that skipped/missed the 400 series and are looking for a great bang-for-your-buck, balanced GPU is going to want to look at AMD's 500 series 4GB offerings."

I have a question regarding the "" Corsair CMK16GX4M2B3200C16W Vengeance LPX 16GB(2 x 8 GB ) on the Asus X370 prime pro.

Do they work together ?

I have Corsair 3000mhz lpx 2x8gb ram here (bought up in anticipation for ryzen but i can no longer return it - CMK16GX4M2B3000C15 ) and from what i read the bios updates are slow going and boards are only starting to get support for this set now. Has anyone got a motherboard that supports this memory at full 2933mhz?

Aiming for x370 as i do want to OC the ryzen at some point (9-12 VRM seems decent?), support VR (so lots of good USB options), maaaaaybe crossfire in the future (probably not tbh) but i want to stay in the price range of £150 for the board and i care not for lighting. I have a ryzen 1600x coming next week.

Anybody got any advice for me? I'm open to B350 boards but I do want to OC and from I've read none of the existing B350 have good VRM parts (though seemingly better support for memory).

Amd,aimidin,8,3,"I have a question for Load Line CalibrationHi guy !

 What is better ?

1. The idle voltage to be higher and when the CPU is under load to drop to the required voltage for your CPU frequency. 

2. The idle voltage to be consistent , or to be moving in small numbers around the voltage that you need. 

3. Or last, the idle voltage to be lower and when the CPU is under load the voltage to go above the idle and be at the required voltage for your frequency. 

With my understanding,  the best stability will be with the second one . But that will also make your idle temperatures higher. 

So let me know what do you guys think about that :)"

However, I want to pick up a RX 570 and wanted to know if anyone has heard from a local retailer or elsewhere if there's any news at all about the RX 500 line up in India. 

I'm expecting launch prices to be pretty bad for a while, even though digit.in says that it'll be ~16K INR. The RX 400 line's pricing was pretty high at launch too, last year and it took almost 9 months to reach a reasonable level. 

Anyhow, if it really turns out to be in that 15K ballpark, then great. If not, then I believe RX 470 will be the way to go. (better get one before they are replaced). "

Amd,Aeternalis_,14,8,"Ryzen QuestionsI made a thread before but a lot has changed.

My first question: What kind of OC can I expect from a 1600? I really want to get it because of the lower price and the included cooler, but some people have said that the overclock isn't guaranteed and I'm not sure about how much of a performance hit I'm going to take. I do game primarily but I am going to stream and use Ryzen for some other content creation. Am I going to be suffering with a 1600? Can an overclock still be done enough to make a significant difference? 

My second question: My build is budget, which is the reason for my first question. I'm not sure what motherbkard I should go for, my case is a standard atx mid tower (Corsair carbid spec 02) so  size isn't a concern, I just don't know what I need. I've been looking at the Gigabyte GA-AB350-Gaming because it looks like it suits my needs. Some reviews say they had trouble overclocking but everything looks fine. Does anyone else have the motherboard? Is the latest bios version decent? Some people are also reporting ram not clocking over 2133, how big of a deal will that be with performance? 

Should I spent more and get a ""better"" board? Do other boards have less potential issues?

Third question: I have windows 7 and I'm not going to 10. Do I need to do a reinstall for a new Mobo?(I haven't had to before) If so, I know how to fix the mouse issue with Windows 7 installations.

I'm just trying to make sure I get the correct setup for my new Ryzen stuff. Thanks in advance, again.

Just giving you guys another update (and of course, another opportunity to join us) on the AMD - Ryzen Builds SETI@Home team. 

Once SETI's website updates our score, we should be ranked #69 in the world with a RAC of about 193,000. That puts us just ahead of the Reddit team (which has double the active users of our team).  We recently earned our 1% badge, meaning we are in the top 1% of SETI@Home teams. 

We have 41 members as of right now, but the total number of Ryzen builds on SETI@Home has more than tripled just in the last few weeks from about 80 builds to over 300. 

If you have any interest in chipping in a little idle computing time, definitely download BOINC and join our team. I would love to get us up into the top 20 teams, but in order to do that we need about 3X the computing power we have right now. The good news is these Ryzen builds are so good on SETI@Home we can accomplish this with far fewer computers than most teams. 

Any questions? Let me know. "

And since i am not willing to pay the extra dollars for G-Sync i will swim with Team Red.

Not so much with the Power Consumption at full load however (we are talking almost a gap of ~70-100W between 1060OC and 580OC).

Could i just get the 580 and underclock/undervolt that to the levels of a 480? Would it even be possible to get a better power consumption at the same clocks compared to the 480?

Do they have issues on long POST/boot times or times it wont boot right away that you have to reset again to get it to POST. Sometimes it will just show black screen and needs a reset again. And also wouldn't boot at 2400mhz without beeping though runs okay at 2133. My mem isn't on msi support list though I found it on the Asus Prime B350M-A Ryzen as supported so I'm considering that.

Currently using MSI B350 Tomahawk which is quite have some issues on it. Others said they have switched to different board like X370s and the issues are gone.

So I'm wondering if buying another B350 chipset will still have this issue. I'm considering buying a new board to replace it and first choice is just another B350 chipset as it's cheaper or move higher to X370 if really that necessary as some have suggested.

PS: I'm all default except m.2 boot device, no OC."

Amd,CatSniff,19,15,"Took me so long to realize why my GPU fans jumped all of a sudden to 100% (3600-3700 RPM)I have an XFX R9 390 and I have a pretty small case, so my two SSDs were placed right behind it(the tail side of it).

Whenever my GPU was being used up to 100%, what would happen is that my SSD temperatures would jump from 30 degrees to 44 and even higher if my gaming session was prolonged.

Right when my SSD temperature reaches around 40 degrees, thats when the GPU fans would go on overdrive and  then the fans would get stuck at 100% (3600-3700 RPM) and they wont go down at all until the SSD temperatures started falling back down to their default temperature state.

Anyone having GPU fan problems, this is probably one of the biggest reasons why your GPU fan controls wont listen to you."

We can guess at Tflops but tbat doesn't translate directly to performance, we can't guess clock speeds because we know nothing about how much better or worse it can be clocked beyond a vague statement that may or may not be true or significant (""vega is designed for higher clock speeds""). We even have quotes from people from AMD who said that VRAM typically makes up 50% of the GPU cost but we don't even know how much HBM2 costs.

We have nothing substantial. With Polaris we could extrapolate everything from the quote ""VR for the mainstream"" AKA R9 290/390 performance for ~$200 (can't believe this was overhyped when it was so obvious what was to be expected) but we have nothing to draw accurate conclusions from yet.

Amd,m00dawg,24,41,"Can someone school me on DDR4 RAM timings when underclocking higher speed RAM?I've got my finger on the button for a Ryzen build but one of the things that made me pause (apart from things being out of stock and still wondering about Linux compatibility) was the statements I've seen for DDR4-3000 RAM.

I didn't see any official statement from AMD, but saw it mentioned that AMD says DDR4-3000 RAM is incompatible (at 3000 speeds). But Corsair, confusingly, is offering Ryzen compatible DDR4-3000 RAM?

Obviously it's being underclocked, which has me wondering - the last time I underclocked RAM was in the DDR2 or even DDR1 days where one could lower the CAS latency when running at the lower speeds. Back then it was to make sure my memory bus was an evenly divided by the CPU bus. These days is any of that relevant?

I was planning on getting 32GB of RAM (more for workstation/multimedia than gaming) and the 4x8GB DDR4-3000 kits from Corsair are fairly inexpensive relative to the other modules. pcpartpicker.com shows that many kits have been getting some price hikes since the Ryzen launch as well. I know if I get 4 modules, I won't be able to OC the RAM as much. I don't always need 32GB so I also though about starting with 2x16GB and adding another 2 later, but I know that can cause compatibility issues if you don't buy matched RAM (at least I got burned by that on my current rig)."

The driver found on the MSI CD when I purchased the card, which I think is the .20 driver, does support 5.1 and correctly recognizes my AVR as the device receiving output.

This is a problem older than dirt.  I upgraded from a 6770 that had the **exact** same issue, solved the same way--by forcibly refusing the system to update the sound driver and only updating video drivers.  

Sadly, their 'clean install' tool wipes all drivers when upgrading, including those I did not select to upgrade.  If I only order it to update the video driver, it will delete BOTH the video and sound driver...then update the video driver alone, and have no sound at all.  So I am forced to only use the regular install option.  I remember the problems that created years ago.

Is there a glaring concern I should be aware of with using old sound drivers?  Or not using clean install?"

My main question is in regard to aftermarket non-reference cards.  Since the aftermarket cards are usually better, I'd most likely want to wait for those if I was getting the 580.  The question is: based on past experiences with AMD releases, when would one expect the non-reference cards to be available?  Ballpark is okay, and as I said, I'm not in any rush.

**Tier1:** Gigabyte - Seems to be having the least number of launch issues, but they still seem to be quite prevalent.

**Tier2:** Asrock - A constant flow of bios updates.

**Tier3:** MSI

**Tier4:** Asus - Crosshair will brick itself, unless you prevent it from doing so.  It also has a default OC out of the box, which some people are having issues with.  They only seem to care about their crosshair when it comes to updates. 

**Tier5:** Biostar - There are some literal horror stories about the biostar bios.  It's basically in alpha atm!


**NOTE:**  All motherboards are having issues with DDR compatibility atm.  That will improve over time.

**Best bang for the buck**
------------------------------

**Tier1:** Asrock - Top notch performance at low prices.

**Tier2:** Gigabyte - Good features at a good price.

**Tier3:** MSI - The Titanium seems to be considerably overpriced. 

**Tier4:** Asus - They are clearly phoning this launch in, while trying to cash in on their name at the same time.

Amd,DuelingRenzoPianos,14,3,"Good AMD GPU for 3d modeling/design...keeping FP64 in mind.I'm relatively fresh to realm of graphic cards. I'm looking to buy a computer geared toward 3d modelling and design, so I've assembled a Dell computer with a 4-core 4.2 Ghz 7th gen i7 (many 3d modeling programs don't support multi-core CPU's). Now, I'm trying to decide what the best value (performance &amp; price) graphics card would be.

Earlier, I was looking at Nvidia cards, and the issue of FP32 vs. FP64 was mentioned. After doing some research, it looks like AMD cards *generally* perform better with FP64 vs. Nvidia cards. The program I hope to use most is Rhino 3d (which doesn't even need a legit FP64 GPU), but if I want to use programs which take advantage of FP64 in the future, I would like a GPU that would back it up.

Say I want to keep the price under $500, what would a recommendation be? With my computer, Dell offers these AMD cards currently. 

*AMD Single*

**AMD FirePro™ W2100 2GB** (2 DP) (1 DP to SL-DVI adapter) [add $88.77]
**AMD FirePro™ W4100 2GB** (4 mDP) (4 mDP-DP adapters) [add $138.63]	
**AMD FirePro™ W5100 4GB** (4 DP) (2 DP to SL-DVI adapters) [add $368.03]		
**AMD FirePro™ W7100 8GB** (4 DP) (3 DP to SL-DVI adapters) [add $697.16]

I thought I'd reach out to the community to see if I'm alone on this. Ever since the first ReLive drivers I've had screen artifacting and flashing. In my steam overlay and in the and driver I get screen tearing, flickering, colors, lines. 


I'm using a MSI R9 390. 

I've tried to:

Reset all clocks / settings to default 

DDU and reinstall 


Each game responds differently. BF4 I get flickering while playing, rocket league it does it when I bring up the overlay and can also happen in game but is rare, doesn't happen in mad Max. 

The most frustrating part of all this? I do not have this problem with the drivers immediately prior to ReLive. Everything works fine on the old drivers but I want the features and optimisations of ReLive.

So as the title states, I have a 4790K and am considering doing a build based on Zen. I was thinking of getting the 1600X but maybe the 1700X or 1800X. IDK if it is practical or reasonable, though. Perhaps you all can help me figure it out.

Here are some details about my situation:

My main application for my PC is gaming. The only other intensive task I ever use it for is video recording and encoding and editing but that is limited. I do YouTube videos just for fun, nothing professional or serious. Other than that, I just use it to watch videos and listen to music. 

I already have a cooler (made by a company which is offering AM4 mounting kits), drives (though I would like one of them sexy NVME drives), PSU, case, monitor, peripherals and OS. I would just need the chip, MOBO and RAM. And I could sell my 4790K, MOBO and RAM to recoup some of my cost. I have also toyed with the idea of selling my air cooler and trying a liquid cooler. But liquid coolers worry me somewhat. But I digress.

But would this actually be a practical or reasonable jump to make? Would I actually see a significant performance increase? Would it be worth the trouble? Or would I just be scratching the upgrade itch?

What do you guys think? Let's assume the leaks we are getting hold true. 

I forgot to add that I use two monitors and run the second off of my 4790K's integrated GPU. It's very convenient. I love it. Will Zen have this? I don't think so. Is it a hassle to run multiple monitors off of one card? One is DP. The other is DVI."

Amd,IAmDescended13,5,1,"Thermal Paste Replaced, Awesome Results!Hi Reddit,

Story:

So I jumped the gun and bought an XFX 480 RS 4GB in September because I had a 7950 and wanted something better.  Unfortunately I wish I had bought the GTR but alas, I have this model!

Long story short I RMA'd a card that would crash when it hit 75 degrees and got a replacement.  

Got the new card stable at 1350/2150 (could go to 2250 on memory but worse results) and at peak (watchdogs/bf1) it would hit 81 degrees, but usually around 77.

Time Jump to now!

I replaced the thermal paste with Thermal Grizzly (going to use it for ryzen and potentially customer water cooling mod for my 480) and HOLY COW.

overclocked that sucker to 1385/2200 and temps stay as they were!

I'm super impressed with what I've accomplished and credit goes to Thermal Grizzly for an awesome thermal paste.

Disclaimer: XFX did a fine job of applying original paste, covered the entire gpu, and just a little dry. aka Thermal Grizzly is great!

Edit:

Before if I bumped up the core to even 1360/1370 the display drivers would crash as it would go up to 85 degrees, I've even modded the bios to allow for +50% power instead of stock +20%.

Kinda figure people would understand that 35 mhz over a stable overclock just by changing paste and keeping the temps the same, and therefore the power draw lower as well,  would be impressive.

So in actuality the thermal grizzly saved me anywhere between 3-8 degrees of heat at peak load."

Amd,virq,29,0,"XFX rx 480 gtr black 8gb, my opinion and a few questions.In every review i see low temps on low fan rmp, no throttling etc. But actual user comments says its hot, loud and its throttling.

So i gave it a try and bought it. Default settings performence bios (its just max rpm settings) 68 C on 95-100% fan rmp...its like turbo engine, i can hear it with closed headphones. Stealth bios (2200 max rpm) it's not loud and card goes up to 77-79 C. All those pro reviews ""68 C 1900 rmp""...maybe i just have a bad luck. Anyway for this card its still very good temperature so it's not a big deal. Xfx is throttling always from 1338 to 1250+~. Giveing more power limit fixed it. I have 3 fans inside my case medium ambient temp and good cpu cooler so it's not the reason of high temps.

I tested some undervolting, gave the card max power limit and thats all. I didn't overclock anything, only undeclocked a bit for tests. I have xfx core pro 650w psu, i also tested my ram and benchmarked cpu to be sure they aren't semi-broken, everything is on stock settings so my problem is only xfx card related. 

Rainbow six siege started to crash after few minutes ""amd settigns crashed etc"". As far as i remember i did't have any error like this before i played with undervolting. Other games seems to be working corectly. Reinstalled drivers etc, gonna try ddu.

So my questions are:

1. Are my temps normal for this card?
2. What about throttling? I heard on xfx gtr black people dont't need to give it more power limit.
3. It's possible that undervolting and changing power limit ocul broke my card?

I'am kinda tired of all those crash, benchmarks...i just want to play some games ;(. I still can give it back to shop so i'am not sure what to do. Sorry for my english and have a nice day."

Amd,UnemployedMercenary,148,83,"The impact of ram speed for gaming. AKA ""how fast ram do i need for ryzen?""Just to get it out of the way, this stuff is related to AMD in the context of all you people tripping over everything while scrambling to buy ddr4 for your ryzen rig before the ram prices go up even more.

Secondly we don't actually have ryzen data, so we're limited to what testing with skylake shows (since skylake uses ddr4 like ryzen).

Sources: http://pclab.pl/art65002-4.html (~~russsian~~ polish, but the graphs are clear enough), https://youtu.be/YUTPgWYTqyk?t=709 (note, the fact it says 6500 OC was cause this vid was made back when people did BCLK on skylake. so look at the non-oc one), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESeoexGLVFU

/u/achross also brought this video to my attention, showing how faster ram ALSO helps the frame times. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er_Fuz54U0Y it won't prevent dips, but it'll smooth them out and make them lower (also repeats the diminishing returns at 3k mhz).

So, what does the tests tell us? There are some key points

* not all games gain anything. Typially small closed map games where everything is preloaded gain very little, with larger open world games that constantly loads in stuff gaining more.

* the gains are usually in the 1-5% range (comparing 2133mhz with 3000mhz), except for extreme cases like fallout 4.

* while gains scale with clock speed, they also cale with cas. This shows us you want both high clocks, and low cas latency.

* the gains scale logarithmically, meaning you see diminishing returns with every step. While it varies from game to game, the sweet spots tend to be around 2600 to 3000mhz. After that you simply don't gain anything significantly, and in many cases you even stop gaining anything entirely.

So to sum up; based on this it seems the ideal ram is in the 3000mhz area with as low latency as possible (so 3200mhz cas 14), at least before considering price (though if you care about price, i'd probably say 3000mhz cas 15)."

Amd,imbecile,6,0,"A different type of mainboard?I was just thinking recently.

Now that the HSA is well established, DDR4 memory is standard, HBM2 probably becoming available to APUs and Vulkan and D12 becoming the new standard APIs, how about this:

You build motherboards with two or more AM4 sockets, that have normal DDR4 slots and optionally an additional HBM2 slot.

And then you can place normal CPUs or APUs in the sockets, or even a pure GPU that also has AM4 pinout.

Since the AM4 CPUs are all SoCs and only require comparatively little functionality on the boards, you'd probably have the space for that even on smaller boards.

What would you gain from it?

It would make the infrastructure so much cheaper, and so much more flexible in configuration.  
No need for extra bulky graphic cards, just standalone GPU chips.  The same sockets and cooling solutions for both CPU and GPU.  
You could make use of all the APU chips from manufacture where you have too few or even no CPU cores to sell them. Just sell them as GPUs.  
The second socket would even provide more IO capabilities and redundancies to the board.  

A customer could choose exactly how many CPU and GPU cores he wants to have. And he could choose if he just wants DDR4 or also some HBM2.  
He could choose to just try DDR4 at first, and then upgrade to get some HBM2 if he needs it."

""I know this is a few weeks late but there is an easier alternative.
Download 16.6 drivers, extract them, then go into that folder, should be something like C:\AMD\Non-WHQL-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Crimson-16.6.1-Win10-Win8.1-Win7-June2

Then navigate to \Packages\Apps\CN\CCCSlim\Core-Static-Net4 and run ccc-slim.msi

Install this to a folder that's NOT your current AMD driver folder, I did it to something like C:\Program Files\AMD\ye olde 

Then navigate to that folder and run CCC.exe.

Now you can tweak your monitor settings. If you want to, you can make a desktop shortcut to that CCC.exe to tweak them any time you want. Radeon Settings additional preferences will still run the newer CCC.exe without monitor colour settings but this old one you have will have them and those settings will stick even with the new driver.


This is a ""dirtier"" alternative but it doesn't require cleaning your drivers with DDU or a single reboot.""

In the future when prices drop, I may consider buying another 480. I mostly enjoy single player games. About the only thing that I play that would need a high FPS or could is rocket league, or CS: GO. I still need to play a lot of old games that I haven't played because I did not have a PC capable enough. 
I have no illusion that I will be able to play the newest games at 4k with my RX 480, but I figure maybe I could play some of the older games. Also, I figure I could just set the resolution to 1080p when ever I need to, plus the price difference between 1080p and 1440p monitors with freesync and this one is not that much.  

So this is the monitor that I want to buy.

Currently its at $290. Currently I have a $20 rewards certificate with BB, and another $25 dollar pending. But, I might not wait for that since I might just take advantage of the $25 off for Visa Checkout that is going on. I currently have a 1080p IPS Lenovo monitor that I bought from BB at $160 I believe and have accident protection on it. 

Some of my questions are:

1. The BB page says the refresh rate goes up to 80 hz but from what I read the freesync is 40-60 fps. Which one is correct?

2. How much would you recommend a 144hz over this?

&gt; Congratulations on reserving SID MIERE'S CIVILIZATION VI - Steam Download! We will update your account and notify you as soon as the game code is available.

Alright, so I waited a week and got nothing, so I decided to write them a [Support Ticket](https://www.amdrewards.com/amdrewards/ticket) - No answer since 2017-01-12...

Since I'm getting a bit annoyed by this, I just resubmitted another support ticket.

How do you even f*** this up? Why is the process so weird? I'd expect the whole 'Steam key from reward code' process to be a pretty straight forward automated task but it seems like there's some human interaction required on AMD's part that leads to the delay?! 

Anyways, has anyone else had bad experiences with AMD Rewards? Will anyone ever answer my support ticket? What else can I do to get through to someone at AMD?

Sorry for the mini-rant but this is my first AMD product in years and I was kind of disappointed by the experience. 

Thanks for listening.

**Edit**: I just noticed the ""SID MIERE'S"". I copied that straight from my email, so that's not *my* typo. I checked and it's the same on the AMD Rewards page :/

**UPDATE** After 2+ weeks, I finally received the key this Monday, 2017-01-23. Guess the new batch of Steam keys arrived since u/MayhemMike also reported getting their key on the same day! I'm downloading the game right now (yay). "

Amd,Paulenski,40,126,"[Bug-Workaround] 150/300 Mhz Memory Stuck 200/300 SeriesHey everyone,

I've come across this with the new Crimson 17.1.1 and simple way to reproduce the bug as well as correct it.

WattMan is the cause...probably or at least related.

Bug Trigger #1: Voltage and memory adjustment in WattMan along with using the ""reset"" option will cause the memory to bug out and won't register higher clocks than 150 mhz (my 290x for example). 

Bug Trigger #2: Driver crashes from overclocking will also make the bug come back, using RadeonMod to quickly restart the driver makes it much easier option than restarting the system each time. This will displace open programs if you use multiple monitors, tends to push everything to main monitor but not all.

#Fix #1: 
Using MSI Afterburner (should work with other overclocking tools), under settings ensure that ""Erase Autosaved Startup Settings"" is checked. Change memory clock values (up or down), apply, then pressing ""reset"" to return to stock values. Then restart your system and don't use WattMan on 200/300 series cards. The ""Chill"" feature can be enabled with no issues, just changing any overclocking values in there may bring the bug back.

#Alternative Fix: 
RadeonMod, a registry editing tool, has a simple ""Restart Driver"" option which will also correct the memory stuck bug, however, if you plan on using WattMan for undervolting or overclocking, you may need to consider Afterburner or other tools for managing these controls until official fixes correct the bug.

#Registry Fix: Thanks to 42Oblaziken for suggestion
This may be a valid fix for some, but I would say be cautious while in registry to avoid breaking your windows install if you aren't familiar with this kind of thing.

**Step #1:** To determine if your system can even use this fix, open registry editor by pressing ""winbutton + r"" and typing regedit into the run command. From there, follow this breakdown:

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Video\

**Step #2:** Once you reach video folder, you will need to search through all of the folders until you find the correct one that has the AMD specific registry controls. [Check this for example.](http://i.imgur.com/BFT5X2p.png) I had multiples which made it a little more work to find than it may have been. You will need this class folder later for the script.

**Step #3:** Once you have the correct folder selected, scroll down and reach the Name value that matches this:
    
    PP_CNEscapeInput

If you have this value, you can just right click and delete. Restart after and the memory bug should be corrected. Now this bug does appear to come back which is why making a simple registry edit script to automatically do this process is so essential until a proper fix comes in. The folder you found under \Video\ is the class name which is needed for the script to work correctly. Take the {Number-Letters} class folder address and insert in the code below.

**Registry script to repeat this process automatically when you boot, still requires you to manually run for effect.**
Create a new text file notepad/wordpad -&gt; copy and paste code below -&gt; save with extension .reg on the end (example: r200-fix.reg) -&gt; run

    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

    [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Video\**Insert address found earlier in the instructions**\0000]

    ""PP_CNEscapeInput""=- 
  


Edit: Added suggested as it may be easier for some and another reproducible case to trigger bug.

Edit #2: Added registry fix suggestion, may only function for some as I don't have this value in my registry."

The survey is for everyone here so I figured I should ask the public before I do anything. Those answers do skew the answers quite a bit, but removing it will mean that I am altering the data. And if you do think I should remove the troll responses, what do you think the limit should be, because we are dictating what we want to see in our responses. For example someone said $40 for a Ryzen 8C/16T Black edition. So what do you guys think? 

On a brighter note, some of you guys submitted some good question suggestions! I'll be sure to put them in on a follow up survey. I might use Google Forms as well so you guys can see the results live (and better public accountability).

Amd,edop2005,27,9,"Best single slot low profile gaming GPU available (R7 250/HD 7750?)Hi,

Which AMD GPU is the best single slot low profile gaming GPU available? It used to be HD 7750 and then the R7 250 (which is just a rebrand). I know there are some RX460 based Radeon pro cards but they are very expensive and not available in my country.

Is there any AIB AMD card better than the R7 250? It s a shame to still have to use an R7 250 in 2017.

The R7 250 GPU perf is still about 2x that of Intel's best iGPU so there is still a use case for such cards.

It looks like low profile single slot cards with a tiny fan can handle up to 50W TDP.

I d love to see an RX450 (could be an unvervolted/undercocked RX460) @ 50W TDP in such a form factor. 

There are a lot of OEM cases or ultra SFF cases that can only accept such a card."

The reason they decided to brand the RX460 as a 896 core GPU was probably because the yields were not so good and maybe some P11 chips had to be cut to 896.

What I don’t understand is why they sold the functioning 1024 core P11 chips as cut down versions, that s literally like throwing money out of the window.
They should have made two tiers of P11 gaming GPU. The 896 core could have been called the RX450 and the 1024 core the RX460. Or RX460 and RX460X whatever marketing thinks is best. But my point is if they were able to manufacture fully functional P11 chips, they should have sold them as is and not artificially cripple them!

I would recommend a card with 6GB of VRAM or more, not sure if 4GB is enough, but I can't test it myself.

So i managed to overvolt and overclock my 8GB sapphire nitro rx 480. And here are my findings for my card. Mind you the most i have added is 50mv. i have yet to try 100mv. photos link bellow.

i managed to get somewhat stable 1470mhz clock speed without going over 70 degrees C. 50mv over, +50% power. The card drew well over 200 watts but i honestly dont care about power draw. just temps and performance. im using an LG ultrawide, freesync, and BF1 on ultra to test it. i ran bf 1 for about 15 minutes and the only crash i got is when i decided to throw myself onto a grenade and then it froze. now oddly enough the game crashed and wattman/crimson reset everything to default.

At 1440mhz, 2200mhz memory, and 50mv over, i managed stable 75FPS with freesync and 102 fps avg with fraps. No crashes. No stutters. NOTHING. UNDER 70 degrees with fans not even at 50%. 40% noise is more than bearable as my case is mostly closed off other than fan intake and exhaust, so its not too loud.

Im hoping to test 1500mhz tomorrow and see how it goes.

Thanks to /u/Ansau for all the help.

Edit: running unigen heaven right now at 1500mhz +100mv. Crashed the test at 5th scene. Under 70° C though. Testing more volts.

Edit2: crashed on same scene with 125mv.

Edit3: So i ran unigen heaven 4.0 on Extreme 1920x1080 at 1500mhz, +150mv, 2200mhz memory. Everything ran just fine untill the last scene and it reset the GPU settings to default. Rerunning tests at 1495mhz.

Edit 4: ran it at 1495mhz core 2200mhz memory. Unigen resuts:

Amd,mariojuniorjp,37,38,"AMD engineers, please tell us the true! Does the Polaris chip have or do not have support for decoding in VP9 4K@60?1 week ago I started a topic here in /r/amd saying AMD's VP9 decode support sucks.

I received negative comments, downvotes and comments trying to assist.

Today, AMD released a new update stating that the problem with the decoder had been resolved. But there's a catch: the problem was NOT fixed.

Some people say that it's not AMD's fault but Google's fault. Well, I re-did the test on the latest Chromium and also on Chrome, and in all two the CPU usage got worse over the last driver! Now it passes the 70% of use!.

I tested a 4K @ 60 video (not VP9) with 50Mbps bitrate (even my S7 Edge can handle this video without any problems) and the CPU usage was also very high!

So finally I tested a video in VP9, with bitrate of 18Mbps. Do you know what the result was? 

Look [here](http://i.imgur.com/PMzVDUn.jpg). 100% CPU usage!

What was the conclusion I came? I see two explanations for this. First, AMD lied in claiming that chip Polaris has decoding for VP9 4k@60.

The second alternative is that AMD simply does not know how to enable it via driver (which I think is completely meaningless).

After all this I would like to know from the AMD itself: the chip Polaris has or does not have support for VP9 4k@60? From what I have observed so far, it seems that the chip does not have support.

Do not do as Intel, which stated that the GPU for one of processors could play a game so fluid, but in fact what playing on the screen was a video running on VLC.

Amd,prometheus_,8,1,"Relive Drivers &amp; my R9 NanoSo my Nano has been pretty good to me. Despite the initial RMA hiccup and it's current glitches (idling problems) that I need to send out for again, the card has been performing flawlessly. 

In games I have had zero graphical or performance issues whatsoever. That said, I thought I'd do a comparison between the previous drivers I was running and the current Relive ones (16.12.1).



 | 16.9.1 | 16.10.1 | 16.12.1 
|-|------|-------|-------
**FireStrike** | **16176** @1020mhz | **16241** @1020mhz | **16380** @1020mhz, **16117** @1000mhz
**FireStrike Extreme** | **7600** @1020mhz | **7620** @1020mhz | **7663** @1020mhz, **7565** @1000mhz
**TimeSpy** | **5005** @1000mhz | **5021** @1000mhz | **5049** @1000mhz

I don't run @ 1020 on the daily, just undervolted at the stock speed. The only reason I keep using 1020 is because that's what I had saved originally and I want to be consistent.    
The only real downside to the ReLive driver is that I can't use my fan profile from Afterburner. Otherwise it's nice to see that the card is getting improved bit by bit :)

MSI Live Update for the new BIOS, thanks /u/professore87

or here a link to the new bios:

EDIT: The bios has new PowerTune Values

* Thermal Design Power	110 W
* Max Power Delivery Limit	150 W
* Thermal Design Current	124 A

EDIT2: seems it only improves the reading in software applications. I tested the power that was drawn from the wall, and it is the same with the two revisions of the bios (*on my system*).

* .152 = ~220w (+/-2%) from the wall running DEUS EX MD DX12-Ultra Benchmark (While reading 120~140w in MSI aferburner)

* .153 = ~220w (+/-2%) from the wall running DEUS EX MD DX12-Ultra Benchmark (While  reading 90~100w in MSI aferburner)

Amd,gnx100,17,4,"75hz Freesync or 144hz Freesync Monitor with an R9 380?Hey everyone,

So I currently use a HP W2371d monitor and was trying to decide what freesync monitor I could replace it with. The monitors I currently have in mind are the ViewSonic VX2457($169AUD) and the ViewSonic XG2401($399AUD). Because I only have an R9 380 I'm not sure if the added cost for the 144hz monitor would be worth it so I'd like to hear what you guys think.

All help is appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: It seems the general consensus seems to be that despite my GPU being not able to hit 144 in current games the 144hz monitor would still be worth it so I've decided that I'll go for the 144hz monitor. 
Thanks everyone :)

Amd,Mariomariamario,9,1,"[QUESTION] Polaris Bios Modding: Mem Controller VoltageAs title, I'm modding the bios of my RX 480 Nitro+ OC, I'm quite unlucky (80% ASIC but I cant't OC s***) my VRAM can reach 2220 MHz but everything past 2100 just spawns EDC Errors (a ~5k at 2150, ~2kk at 2220, crash past 2220). I still have to touch Core frequency and voltage, I want to tweak my VRAM first. I decided to improve timings, at 2100 with the 1750 strap copied onto the 2000 strap i just need to raise the memory voltage to 1025 mV to be perfectly stable (if not I get like 10 errors, nothing to be worried about but I want to be safe). My current plan is to raise the voltage to 1150 mV (the max safe mem voltage) find the tightest stable timings (following this method: https://youtu.be/TR25v-jvWao , starting from 1750 timings as base) and later, find out if I can lower the voltage a bit (I hope 10/20 mV).

I modded my bios like this:
- TDP and Max Powerlimit = 225
- TDC = 190
- Copied 1750 timings to 2000 strap
- Set 1150 mV next to 2000 MHz memory frequency

I didn't change the frequency to 2100 and left it at stock 2000, so I'm sure that the card boot and I can set it manually by &lt;WattMan/WattTool/any_oc_tools&gt; (when I find the best timings I'll set 2100 inside the bios).

Btw, the real question is, now the memory is perfectly stable but WattMan and WattTool still shows me 1000mV, since the m is stable should I assume that the 1150mV is correctly applied but the oc tools shows me 1000mV just because it should be the default value? Can someone try/confirm this thing? Is 1150 the max safe voltage for memory controller? Is 1.300v the max safe voltage for core (future plans)?

Amd,Martin_online247,17,12,"Sapphire Rx 470 8GB or R9 390 8GB (solved :D) StoryHello AMD :)

I realy need to give Sapphire a big thx for their awesome cards...


Here is my story:
A long time ago i got an Oculus Rift DK2 for Birthday from my GF. At the time i was running a x6 1090t and a R9 270x 4GB (Sapphire :P) and the most games didnt run so well in VR...

So i decided to buy an R9 390  to get back to business :)
Games ran well and the r9 390 was realy quiet.

Now over a year later, we are still playing games in VR. Her favorite is Luckys Tale and my favorite is Elite Dangerous...
I had some parts and to biuld her, her own pc for VR.

Fx 8320e, Matx Asus Board (asrock board was trash...) 16gig, sandisk ssd 240gb, and a Thermaltake Core V21 ""tower/cube"".

I decided to buy her a Sapphire rx 470 8gb card because i thought it would handle vr well enough and didnt cost too much.

After the first few hours playing around with undervolting i was a bit shocked...
Stock boost, stock ram and mhz... But it runs stable with
815 - 825 - 825- 825 - 850 - 875 - 935 mv@ 1300mhz... Stock mv was around 1126mv @ 1260mhz... It reduces the drawn wattage of the pc (overall) from 260w to around 200-210w in unigine Valley...

I switched the card to my pc and it performed a bit better than my r9 390 (in most games and firestrike) But the overall power draw fromt the wall is reduced from:

r9 390 ~ 440w

Rx 470 stock ~ 300w

Rx 470 uv ~ 260w

My pc has several hdds, ssds and beside all the contoller and fans, the main power eater is the old x6 1090t with his oc... (waiting for Zen)


Additional, beside undervolting i managed 1425mhz (could possibly higher) on stock 1126mv... ( http://www.3dmark.com/fs/10835951 )

I am more than impressed by the Rx 470 8gb... No drawbacks to my old 390 but way less power consumption...



**tl;dr**

So if you ever need to consider between those 2 cards... Go for the rx 470... The power you are saving is ridiculous...


P.S.:

Its my first time doing anything like this so thanks guys from my previous thread for the tips (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/5doy7p/xfx_rx_470_rs_black_edition_wattman_voltage_stages/)

First thing i noticed when i ran benchmarks (Fire Strike) was the awful throttling. Core clocks never went over 1200 Mhz. So i increased power limit to +30, and it still wasn't reaching 1256 Mhz it stated on box, plus the card was getting hot. It only reached 1256 Mhz after i put power limit up to +50. 
Since this made my card go near the boiling and the damn thing is noisy even at default fan settings, I decided to underclock, undervolt decrease power limit.

At default setting core clock speed averaged at about 1170 Mhz, so i decided to set clock speed at 1150 Mhz. It now runs stable at 950 mV,(though i read somewhere Wattman wont let you go under 987 mV no matter what value you type in.) -7% power limit, and 68-70 deg C. at 56% fan speed. I chose these settings mainly to keep the noise down since anything above 2300 rpm (56%) makes my case resonate like crazy and card now runs a bit cooler.

Here are my settings:

Amd,Waterblink,54,20,"Questions about AMD's CPUs in recent years (Phenom, Bulldozer)With Zen around the corner (choo choo!!), I am growing increasingly curious about the performance of AMD's chips in recent years.


I built this pc around 2011, around that time all the talk was about Sandy Bridge basically beating AMD down to a pulp. However, that was all I knew about AMD during that time, and that's also where my knowledge of PC parts begins, timeline wise.


During those times, I knew a lot of people were still rocking Phenoms, Thubans to be specific. They were also buying these chips instead of Intel's offering. 

My questions therefore are as follows:

How did these Phenoms compare to Intel's chips before Sandy Bridge was released? Was AMD able to hold its own?


What were the rumors that were floating about Bulldozer? I remember the hype, but I don't remember what kind of rumors were present back then. Did people say that it would be near Sandy Bridge performance? Were there rumors of it beating Intel? All I really remember was it having lots of cores but severely lacking in the IPC department.

Amd,LITTLE_FSCOMEAU,25,37,"AMD's future for Deep LearningSo I don't usually state my opinion about anything but if anything AMD has a lot of room for potential. The gaming and VR sectors are continually expanding, and thus the size of the pie is growing. This is great for AMD. I understand that AMD is trying to focus on these main efforts to improve profit margin and compete with Nvidia but I don't see them as much of a player in the deep learning (DL) or computational markets at all, because of the lack of OpenCL or team to deliver hardware-optimized instruction sets for DL (mainly convolutions, reduced precision operations). Having a team (just a couple people) that does a better job at releasing good software would allow AMD to directly compete against Nvidia (who has a monopoly now). Hopefully they are moving towards this goal (as evident by the recent cloud deal).

Being a regular user and software contributor for  large-scale deep learning myself (using 32+ Titan X distributed), I am greatly infuriated when AMD has the same perf/watt and a much lower cost (Titan X's are $1.2k and K80s are a couple ks) and yet don't have a modern software stack that is conditioned for DL and ML. OpenCL gets a lot of heavy criticism as being &gt;2x worse at the same operations per second. If they would just improve this a bit, I could see AMD picking up many more opportunities for big cloud deals with Amazon, Google, Apple, self-driving cars, and robotics.

These are just my two cents. I am also bummed that I lost a lot of money on earnings yesterday....


EDIT:
HERE's something they can do to catch people's attention:
In tensorflow, torch, caffe, open up a github repo and add benchmarks that are ON-PAR with Cuda/cudnn's convolutions. If they show the benchmarks (in speed, maybe also in $), they can REALLY shock the deep learning community which is largely (and naively) Nvidia driven. Doing this would be amazing.

2nd edit:
So after some research it looks like they are working in the communication bottleneck through ROCm, which is cool. I think part of the problem is the ignorance in DL communities. Many people just take the words of experts and move on (perhaps because of how quickly the field seems to generate new and cool results). So I think that part of the problem is AMD's publicity work that needs to show what their products can do to the end-users in the DL community. "

Is Zen expected to be cheaper than the current Gen of Intel CPUs (if you take two CPUs with the same perf).


Do we know when will HBM memory be available to buy and if it's going to be more expensive than the DDR3/4 ?


Are AMD motherboard cheaper than intel ones because i heard motherboard with SLI are more expensive because nVidia sells the SLI license ( or something like that ) and idk if there is something similar with Intel."

Amd,kntslutfox,19,1,"My Plan for Upgrading my AMD PC on the CheapSo here's the specs to my current rig:

CPU: Phenom II X6 1100T @ 3.3Ghz

GPU: Radeon R9 270X

RAM: 8 Gigs of DDR3 @ 2000mhz - G.Skill

MOBO: ASUS ROG Crosshair IV Formula 

Storage: 500 gigabytes in the form of a 7200rpm Seagate Hybrid Drive.

PSU: Corsair TX750


Not a bad little system and it's been my daily driver for 5 years now, built back in 2011 but the video card has been replaced twice. I believe the original card was a Radeon 6870 and my second was a GTX 660 Ti and now I have the R9 270X which has lasted the longest by far. 

Anyways, My plan is to upgrade to a AM4/Zen based computer when AMD releases that line of CPUs next year. I'm going to keep my graphics card, it's only 3 years old and I'm happy with how it performs for now (It's somewhere between a RX 460 and 470 but it's closer to the 460 than 470). And of course I'm also going to reuse the Corsair PSU because damn that thing is awesome and puts out plenty of power. I also have a Corsair all in one watercooler that I'm gonna reuse. I might reuse the 500gig drive as well but I dunno.

 That just leaves getting the CPU, Mobo, and RAM and an SSD for storage. I'm thinking something like this: 
An AM4 CPU similar to Intel's Current i5 line that's around 200$ bucks or less.
I don't want to spend 200+ dollars on a mobo like I did with this one, I want to keep it under 100 dollars because honestly the mobo just needs to work and support the components I'm gonna use, OCing support and whatever else will just be bonuses if they're included. 

For the RAM I'm just gonna go with 2 8gig sticks of DDR4 RAM with a decent speed, I'm probably just gonna get some G.Skill sticks again but whatever's a good deal at the time. 
I want like a 240 gig SSD because that'll be sufficient because I have a terabyte drive lying around I can put in there with it.

 So, I'm wanting to spend around 400 dollars or less for all this so I can upgrade my aging CPU and platform, It'll be a breath of fresh air to know that I'm not running on a 6 year old CPU even if I'll have a relatively weak GPU until I upgrade it later. Thoughts and Opinions? Anyone planning to do a similar thing? "

Amd,ZionHalcyon,42,1,"Have to say, NOT happy with XFX tech support right now. DISAPPOINTED!Putting this up because people wanted to know how this went.  Bought a 390 September of last year (390 Black, Double Dissipation for about $379).  Over, I've been happy with the card.

However recently, it was artifacting intermittently.  I finally put in a support ticket this week (I registered it over the summer because I had forgotten about the paperwork, and then came across it while looking for something else, and registered it then).

So, XFX support has no #, only a website that says they will get back within 24-48 hours.  Not ideal, and definitely not the best Customer Service site, but I figured what the heck.

So I put in the help ticket, and got the usual ""have you tried these troubleshooting steps?"" response within 24 hours. Ok, no problem.  I understand that they'd want me to do that (even though I explained in the ticket that I get no problems from my on board Mobo VGA for display, which eliminates RAM as a potential issue).  I did the clean uninstall of drivers and reinstall as they requested. 

Same issue, so I let them know in the ticket and requested an RMA.

It's now been past 48 hours as of today.  That troubleshooting is the one and only thing they have reached out to me on.  This is starting to turn frustrating and I am NOT happy.

I will admit, I am in part putting this up here because I also have seen on occasion people from XFX post here (usually in XFX praise threads), so I am hoping if they see this, they can give their crew over in Hong Kong a kick in the ass to get them moving on this.  My ticket is T1610180023.

In the meantime, if anything changes, I'll let people here know.  I think a company is only as good as their customer service when something goes wrong..."

I was interested in what the title is, an AMD PC Case. I only found an NZXT case that wasn't even close to my expectations. Then, after tons of searching I've reached an era in which AMD loved to give case manufacturers licenses to make wonderful AMD themed cases. The case I got I will not state yet, but i'm glad I got it new.

Back to the topic, I want to spare some of you the pain of searching, giving a handy list of the available cases.

I think nowadays, many miss out on the touch that AMD have had on cases in earlier days. For those of you who ever wanted an AMD PC Case, here are some antiques. You may have not known about. All of these are *discontinued*. The below listed cases are not region restricted and should've been available globally at launch. I try not to list items that have been restricted to certain regions.

And all get a rating from *1* to *5*, with 1 being common, 2 being uncommon, 3 being very uncommon, 4 being rare and 5 being super rare. My personal rating.

Below they are.

Amd,El_Guapo_The_Gamer,39,3,"FX 6350 OC HelpSo I am somewhat new to overclocking CPUs. Right now I have a multiplier OC on my FX 6350 ~~(Currently at 4.0 GHz)~~ (Currently at 4.1 GHz thanks to you folks) ~~and was wondering how far I can safely push it with the stock cooler along with some help on how to do so.~~ 4.1GHz is the safest OC I have tested will test a 4.2GHz OC soon

I have put my main questions into a list.

~~1: Besides the multiplier what else do I need to tweak to get over 4.0GHz and to keep it stable.~~ Disabled Turbo Core Technology, changed my multiplier, and changed the frequency

~~2: What is the safe temp for a FX 6350 (can't get a solid answer anywhere on the web)~~ 70c is what the consensus is.

~~3: Does the amount and speed of my RAM limit me?~~ Not the amount but frequency and I should use a dual channel kit but not crucial

My system specs if you you lovely folks need them.

CPU: FX-6350 Clocked at ~~4.0GHz~~ 4.1GHz

GPU: EVGA GTX 960 4GB FTW 

MB: ASRock 960GM-VGS3 FX 

RAM: 1x8GB DDR3 1333MHz 

HDD:1TB Seagate 7200RPM

~~EDIT 1: Received some help but I am still not convinced on temps. Temps are the biggest issue from what I know about overclocking a CPU. What is AMD's stance on a safe temp? Is there one? FX CPUs were made to be tweaked by the user but they must have done some test of their own.~~ 70c is the consensus =)

Edit 2: So helpful all of you. But now I have new questions. 

* 4: If I should get a new motherboard can you recommend one that isn't too expensive? Something under a hundred bucks that can handle overclocking is what I would need. 

* 5: If I need different/more RAM can you recommend a dual channel kit or even just an extra single stick of DDR3?

* 6: CPU cooler people say the Coolermaster 212 but are there any other coolers you would recommend? 

Edit 3: Now at a steady 4.1GHz stress and game tested.

Typically, I'll get a crash every other match, which always happens the same way. The graphics will freeze, but the audio will continue to play, and the game registers my clicks for aiming, locking in my turn, etc. Typically after another half turn or so (of just audio), the client will crash. I don't think it's due to my video card overheating (it doesn't get hotter than 77 during gameplay), and I don't have these issues with other games I play, but my HD 7950 is almost 4 years old.


I'm beginning to think that the issue is on my end, for two main reasons. First, I haven't seen anyone else experiencing the same problem. Second, the ""crash"" is due to Windows shutting down the client (I get an ""Atlas Reactor has stopped working"" prompt), and the game continues to run after the video cuts out. I have the latest drivers and version of Crimson (16.9.1).

Amd,NeoMatrix2525,10,0,"My Frustrating Road to Overclocking My Non-Reference RX 480 and Getting the Most Out of ItSo, this post is going to be a bit of a rant, a bit of information, and hopefully agreeable to some opinions and discussion.  I have owned an XFX RX 480 GTR Black card for almost three weeks now, and spent the last several days figuring out how to get the highest stable overclock and best performance I could out of it.

The short of it all is that I am now running my card stable at 1410 mhz core @ 1250 mv, 2125 mhz memory @ 1075 mv, and +45% power, and am more than pleased with the performance.  I managed this overclock using both Wattman and Trixx together, and despite seeing some posts around here warning they don't run well together, I seem to only have a couple minor issues that I can live with.  And for anyone interested, here's the Firestrike Score [Link](http://www.3dmark.com/fs/10229576): 11320 Overall, 14717 Graphics.

Alright, now the long version: When I got my card, I didn't think overclocking the memory a bit would be an issue, and wanted to focus on how high I could push the core, so I started my overclocking venture using Trixx exclusively so I could increase the core voltage.  Turns out the card I recieved did not win the binning lotto with the memory chips, and ended up about average for the gpu core itself.  After a lot of benchmarking, and stress testing, I ended up with the underwhelming result of 1390 core @ +75mv, 2050 mem and +40% power.  Anything higher on either the core or the memory would give me an eventual crash within games like Rise of the Tomb Raider or Doom anywhere within an hour.

So, I uninstalled Trixx and decided to see where I could get with Wattman.  After excruciatingly long testing for memory errors with HWiNFO (which apparently has some conflicts with my system configuration or the gpu driver and is the topic of another discussion) I found I could hit 2125 mhz @ 1075 mv.  With either lower, or higher voltage, I would start getting errors, and no matter what I tried, I can't get the memory clocked any higher without getting errors in the tens of thousands.  Still, the memory is rock solid at that setting and not too bad sitting halfway to 2250.  However, in Wattman, I could only get the core to 1370 @ 1175.  So, the max stable overclock with Wattman was 1370, 2125, +40% power.

Now, at this point, if I had more confidence, I would have probably dumped my 480 bios and tried editing the memory voltage and reflashing.  However, the last time I did anything like that was after I purchased a (at the time) new MSI Radeon 9800 Pro and flashed it with 9800 XT Bios to great effect.  So instead, I decided to find out if I could use the memory voltage set in Wattman, and control the core clock and voltage through Trixx.  Turns out it works pretty well with a couple caveats.

I first adjusted all of the Wattman settings to the values I needed.  Memory voltage, speed, power limit, and temp target.  I left the core clock at 1370 and 1150 mv.  After applying those settings, I opened Trixx, and adjusted the core to where I currently have it stable at 1410 @ +100mv.  All of the other Trixx settings match Wattman, with the Fan setting left to Auto on Trixx.

The settings work, and even after applying the settings in Trixx, it keeps the 1075mv memory voltage from Wattman.  So, the only two issues I've encountered.  If I need to restart my system, when I get back into windows, all of the Wattman settings are reset back to defaults when I open it, and need to re enter all the values.  And two, between setting a temperature target in wattman and leaving the Fan setting on Auto in Trixx, after I close a game, the fans don't always spin down and stop on their own, and instead get ""stuck"" however fast they were spinning when I closed the program.  In that case, I go back into Trixx and simply re-apply the profile settings, and the fans fix themselves.  I'm not sure if setting a custom fan profile in Trixx would fix things, but I'll experiment with that later.

So, though potentially ill-advised, it took two overclocking programs together to get the best result out of my card.  I don't suppose anyone else has had this much trouble, or enough patience, to figure out how far they could push their card and keep it stable?

Hmm, I guess I rambled longer than I thought..."
Amd,U-S-Eh,6,3,"Why isn't /r/radeon used at all?/r/radeon is a nice looking subreddit and it would make sense to split off GPU specific threads, whether it's for support with games/new drivers, or benchmarks relating directly to video games, graphics cards, etc.

I got myself an MSI rx480 8G recently. Now my CPU isn't great (i5-4670K) but it feels like I'm straight up getting less performance than I had with my sapphire r9 280x

What happens is that I basically have to enable compatibility mode or any game I launch will immediately crash the display drivers, crashing the game.

I've looked up what it could be, in the end all I can find is that my full PC crashes seem to be from the card drawing too much power, and the issue above seems to just be instability.

Are all of you having issues too or is it just me? Is there an easy fix besides turning on compatibility mode?

I'm about to purchase an actively cooled RX460 by XFX with a single fan. I don't intend to do much gaming with it, I mostly buy a graphics card because Intel CPUs with more than four cores don't feature integrated graphics.

Is it possible to set the graphics card's fan not to spin below 55 degrees Celsius of chip temperature? I've read that at idle, the chip's temperature is at around 33 degrees, so I presume 55 degrees would provide enough headroom for basic desktop applications and video watching (at a 1440x3440px screen) for the fan never to spin. Is this assumption correct?"

Amd,Sammael_Majere,7,0,"Would a lower clocked / lower ipc zen 8 core be better than a quadcore kaby lake cpu for gaming?I know the short answer is that we don't know yet, we don't know the ipc across a broader range of activities, or the final clock speeds.

But based on what I've read it sounds like zen will be around 4% lower ipc than skylake, and maybe a few more percent with kaby lake, if not more.

Not a huge difference there, but the real question will come down to clock speeds.  kaby lake is a much later revision of intels 14nm process, I'd imagine it will have a meaningful clock speed boost over whatever zen is able to achieve.

So, assuming that is true.  Will games benefit more from having twice the cores/threads, or a quad core / 8 thread cpu with higher performance per core due to being slightly ahead in ipc and raw clock speeds?


Is it more game dependent?  How many games only scale to 4 cores 8 threads vs double that?

I have been waiting for the RX 480 for quite some time, as has many others here, but the prices are still too high for it seems.  Lately I've seen a few deals here and there for R9 Fury, and Fury X, as well as the occasional ""open box"" deal on 390Xs.  Are these cards something I should be considering?  Especially now with the recent sales?  Right now I'm looking at the following as substitutes for rx 480.

Sapphire Nitro R9 Fury ~$350
Asus Strix R9 Fury ~$340
Asus Fury X ~375
XFX R9 390X ~$290

Obviously these are all priced higher than what I was originally planning on spending (230-250 for a 480), but because of the 480 price gouging and the R9 sales, I'm now seriously considering it.  Some other considerations, this is for a mainly gaming, occasional CAD situation.  On a 1080p 144hz monitor (freesync so I haven't been looking at nvidea's options).  I understand the 470 can be had at more reasonable and closer to msrp prices, but I think I want a little more than that, although my mind is open to what you have to say.

So I was just browsing on NCIX and noticed that the price of the Gaming X 480 is now $420. That seemed a little odd to me, considering that I ""back-ordered"" (even though it now says ""pre-order"" even after they told me several times that it was simply on back-order) the same card for $400. The Nitro+ (OC) 8gb is still selling for $400 on their site and on Vuugo (the only Canadian retailer that seems to have it in stock). I could be wrong, but even CanadaComputers have raised their price by $10 for the Gaming X ($400 to $410). 
  
Does that mean that there's going to be an even smaller supply of Gaming X cards than previously thought? Or are they simply changing their pricing in response to the perception that the Gaming X is a better card than the Nitro+? It's my first time seeing a price change in response to demand/supply from a retailer for consumer goods over such a short period of time.

Amd,LightTracer,58,28,"RX 480 available in Europe, when?It has been almost 2 months and there are still no custom versions of RX 480s available in Europe at many shops and those that list the rare ones have no stock or crazy prices.

Even reference models are gone now and pretty much no 480s are available at all. Prices hiked up again as retailers are getting nothing to sell.

WTH is going on with AMD board partners that they can't supply any reasonable quantity of AMD GPUs at all. Either they sell all cards to Asia located miners or I don't know.

2 months AMD and not a single card that has been launched is available at any decent quantity let alone custom designed ones.

Might as well buy Nvidia because there are no AMD cards to buy at all. AMD can only blame themselves for poor market share in gaming when they do not provide almost any decent supply and if they do sell cards they end up in bulk in mining farms.

When can we expect a decent supply from AMD and it's board partners? It's been 2 months now, come on...

However, if AMD can't pump out a card at the high $300s, I will end up getting a 1070 (which is fine) and not be able to use freesync.

Amd,Leaf-Storm,16,2,"need some more advice. rx 480 probably wont come for another month or so, should i switch my order to an in-stock 470?after discovering that the r9 390 wont fit in my case due to my network card being in the way, i thought about switching to the xfx 470 black edition, which is in stock. is this fine for 1080p gaming at high/ultra settings for a while?

EDIT: i changed my order and im getting it tomorrow :D. finally i can play doom"
Amd,TheAlbinoAmigo,39,32,"Upgrading a Tri-X 290 to a Nitro Fury - 1440p Benchmarks, Temperature, Noise, and Coil Whine.Hi guys,

I've thrown together a mini-review of my experience so far with my new Nitro Fury card. I thought it might be useful for people like me who were looking for something with a bit more oomph than something like a 290, but weren't sure if a Fury was a worthwhile upgrade. Hopefully this will help some of those people out.

So, let's begin:

**FORM FACTOR, APPEARANCE, AND POWER**

The Nitro Fury is a huge card. Compared to my 290 Tri-X, it's bigger in all three dimensions. It's 2-3mm longer and taller (taller being the dimension perpendicular to the mobo), and ~5mm wider due to the cooler actually extending above the PCIe bracket. This is probably worth noting - if you have a Wifi/sound card in the next slot, the Nitro Fury might present some problems for you since you need to treat it almost as if it's a 3-slot card, but you will have to do a little extra research for yourself to figure out if you have enough room in your case or not. 

The card looks fantastic in my opinion. The build quality looks notably better than for my 290 - the cooler is sturdy and well-built (no creaky-looking plastic bits which don't *quite* fit together neatly). The Fury has a **bitching** backplate, and it really does give it that nice aesthetic edge over the 290 inside the case. Well, actually, in my case you can't see the backplate (Prodigy M has an inverted mobo mount), but if I could, it'd be much nicer than before. 

The Fury has 2x8pin connectors for power, and two BIOS settings for different targets. One BIOS targets 260W, and the other 300W. I set mine to the 300W BIOS setting to give myself some headroom later on if I wanted it. From other reviews I've seen around, the Fury Nitro has a very similar power draw to the 290, so if you're doing the same as me and could handle a 290 beforehand, you should also be able to handle the Fury. 

**NOISE, TEMPERATURES, AND CLOCK PROFILES**

I'll start off by saying that having fan-idling when not under load is awesome. The card is totally silent in desktop environments. This is a pretty common feature on new cards, but it's new to me and it's great since my 290 was just about audible in these situations before. 

Under gaming workloads, I found fan noise to be fairly good. The fans ramp up to audible levels, but compared to my 290 they're practically silent still. Their is ZERO audible noise moving between fan-idling and fan-spinning modes, and even at peak temperatures the card remains relatively quiet in my case (which has no sound dampening qualities). The fan noise is also fairly low register, so it doesn't stand out against my case fans or PSU, which again is better than for the 290. At default clocks and voltages (and above), coil whine becomes audible (like a high frequency clicking noise), but remains relatively unremarkable with the case doors on. It's definitely audible, so if you're particularly sensitive this could be an issue for you. Having said that, I will come back to the coil whine issue shortly, and you should at least read that far.

Temperatures are pretty good for this card in my experience. My case has fairly poor airflow (even with 5 case fans installed) due to it's inverted mobo mount (GPU needs to pull air DOWN, against the physics of warm air...), but temperatures at stock clocks didn't exceed 83'C in any benchmarks I ran. Other reviews for this card pin temperatures at low-to-mid 70's under load, so take temps with a grain of salt from me. As a reference, at stock settings my 290 Tri-X would sometimes hit up to ~90'C on warmer days. 

Messing around with clock profiles, I found some interesting stuff. The factory OC on this card means it runs at 1050MHz on the core at stock (a 50MHz OC). I found two viable options for messing with clock profiles with this card:

1) Overclocking the core. At stock voltages I pushed my core clock up to 1100MHz with zero issue (absolutely zero tweaking). I saw &lt;5% gains across the board from every benchmark scenario, but the tradeoff was a few degrees of extra heat and more coil whine. This sort of setup is fine if you're wearing headphones, but I started to really notice the coil whine when just using my speakers with my PC under the desk at these clocks. Still, that's a fairly respectable 100MHz boost over the AMD-specified stock clock, without even overvolting. Other reviews tend to be able to push this clock up to a maximum of ~1130-1150MHz. OCing the memory seems like a small waste since bandwidth is a comfy 512Gb/s to begin with thanks to the 4GB HBM used. 

2) Undervolting the core at stock clocks. This card undervolts beautifully for me. I managed to push my core at 1050MHz with a -72mV offset and total stability in everything I've tried so far. This reduced temps a few degrees, but most importantly **near-eliminated coil whine**. I am talking subjectively here, but I **couldn't** hear any whine in any benchmark scenario after this, except for Witcher 3 where I had to have my ear nearly touching my case to be able to pick it up. As mentioned before, this cost me less than 5% in performance compared to the 1100MHz clock profile. I'd stick to undervolting this card if you have issues with coil whine. 

**PERFORMANCE**

All benchmarks were taken with my 290 Tri-X at it's stock 957MHz clock, and with the Fury at 1100MHz **unless stated otherwise**. All benchmarks were conducted at 1440p **unless stated otherwise**. Benches were ran with an i7-4770k clocked to 4.0GHz. Normative percentages are taken from Avg framerates or synthetic GPU scores. Settings I've given are what I personally feel offer the best trade-off of performance vs. image quality. Settings like shadows in Witcher 3 look practically identical to me moving from medium to ultra yet there is a significant performance hit for using the Ultra setting.

***Rainbow Six: Siege (Max, but medium shading and reflection, temporal filtering on)***

*Note: Minimum frames for the R6: Siege benchmark look very harsh, but seem to occur ONLY within the first few seconds of the benchmark for me, and aren't representative of usual lows throughout the benchmark.*

***Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (Max settings, shadows medium and foliage distance on high, no hairworks)***

*Note: since there's no official benchmark for this, I just loaded the game overlooking Toussaint and didn't move the camera so both cards had the same scene to draw. Obviously, this doesn't reflect framerate variance in-game as a result.*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**290:** 45.6 (100%)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

***Average Normalised difference at 1440p (equal weighting in all benches)***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**290:** 100%

**Fury 1100MHz:** 135.3% 

[TPU in their review also found at 1440p that the Tri-x Fury (same clocks as Nitro) was 35.1% faster than the 290. Huh.](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Sapphire/R9_Fury_Tri-X_OC/30.html) Also, none of my benchmarks are in the new APIs outside of synthetics. This might be important in the future, as theoretically speaking the Fury has enough TFlops at peak to be *consistently* 50% faster than the 290, like I see in Witcher 3. DX11 might have some overhead issues which leaves a larger proportion of the shaders on the Fury idling compared to the 290; I may come back to this at a later date when I have some games with the new APIs. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**CONCLUSIONS**

Is the Fury a notable upgrade from the 290 at 1440p? Absolutely - I didn't see any scenario where the Fury was &lt;30% of an improvement over the 290 except for Dirt Rally. This all comes down to pricing and personal requirements as usual. I bought this card from OCUK B-grade section for £250. At £250, I feel that the Fury is a worthwhile upgrade if you are hungry for one, but at £300 and above I feel a good deal of this value is diminished, personally. I think having this card in my hands now, that I may actually wait out until Navi drops rather than jump on Vega (unless Vega has some sort of magical 50%+ performance leap over the Fury), which for the price I paid makes it feel ultimately worthwhile for me. Of course, YMMV on this front. 

In terms of thermals/power/noise, the Fury is **hands down** the better card of the two, given what I have said above. If you're sick of your 290's noise output in particular, I couldn't recommend this card more.

Amd,Johners96,11,2,"The current state of AMD-powered laptops?Hello,  
  
A few years back I had a Samsung laptop with an AMD APU, the A8-3530MX to be exact. It was a good laptop but has since been replaced with a Lenovo Z50-70 with an i5-4210U and an 820M.  
  
While I like this laptop, Nvidia Optimus is a bit meh (mostly due to sub-par Linux support) and I can probably see myself getting something newer and smaller in the next few years.  
  
I know the market can change in a few years but I just wanted to know what the current AMD laptops were like in terms of price to performance but also when it comes to buying a premium laptop that is well built (my Samsung was rather thick and was also plastic). Also, have AMD shown signs of helping OEMs produce high-end laptops (something like a Dell XPS 13 for example)?"

Amd,leftisthominid,9,1,"Overclocking an FX 6300 for a GTX 1070I have an FX 6300 with a Hyper 212 EVO on a M5A99FX PRO R2.0. I never got around to overclocking it, but once I get a GTX 1070, I will probably need to.

I was wondering if anyone could provide me any suggestions/guides on how to overclock the FX 6300 enough to minimize the bottleneck. Thanks!

Also, the PC games towards the top of my backlog are The Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed Syndicate (just the Jack the Ripper DLC and WWI missions), and GTA V. Will any of those games severely bottleneck?

Also, it is my assumption/understanding that bottleneck will primarily tank my framerate more so than other aspects of the visuals, is that correct?"
Amd,firagabird,11,9,"Why does LFC in Freesync require such a large refresh range?I love the idea of variable refresh rate, and see the potential in the concept of an economical standard that many monitors can implement. What I don't get is why Freesync's low framerate compensation (LFC) requires a max refresh rate that's 2.5x the minimum one.

I get the basic mechanics of the feature: If the FPS drops below the minimum refresh rate, the monitor duplicates the last image at the speed of its max refresh rate. This avoids turning off V-sync (and showing wicked tearing at that low FPS) while keeping the delay between fresh frames to a minimum.

Perhaps I'm missing something obvious, but thanks to my lack of detailed understanding of LFC, I don't get why there's a 2.5x requirement. Is there a good reason for this, or is it an arbitrary value set by AMD in their driver? This prevents a largely cheaper majority of Freesync monitors from benefitting from LFC, which makes it harder for me to get a good, affordable monitor."
Amd,collinfirth,9,1,"Unrealistic Dream: Watercooled Reference RX 480 w/ Stock ShroudI don't know about you people, but I am in love with the reference design of the RX 480 (and of course the Fury X). So much so that I ditched my STRIX 390x (for temp, TDP, noise and size) for a XFX reference 480. Truly I think the minimal design is just perfect while I find the new novideo's Founders Editions to be brash and ugly. So far I am satisfied, I got everything I wanted from my purchase but I want to overclock it with low temps. I don't care so much for memory OC but I want to merge the spirit of a Kraken G10 and a core water cooler retained INSIDE the reference shroud while still using the blower fan. 
Its an unrealistic desire, google searches of what I want have shown me that, but I am so in love with this cheap and simple cooler design that I may try it out in the future.

Currently I do own one 144hz Freesync monitor, and I'm thinking about going triple screen. 

The thing is: the 1060 is sometimes 20% better than the 480 on DX11 titles. I know the RX480 excels at DX12, but as I said, I won't be playing those in the near future (at least not in the next 3 years).

Amd,PyroShoot,99,95,"True OC potential of RX 480.So I have read some reviews that do test overclocking on RX 480 (both reference and AIB), many of them leave the power target at stock then made a conclusion that the card is bad at overclocking.  
I have been following the owners of RX 480 on OCN for a while now and conclude that it is not true and the stock power target is severely limiting the card's overclocking power.  
Here are results of one guy doing a thorough test on the card:  
http://www.overclock.net/t/1606214/personal-comparison-of-stock-480-vs-max-oc-480   
Overall increase performance is 14%, but note that his stock setting is already set at 150%, compared to a 100% stock card the increase in performance is close to 20%.  
Compare his result with MSI 1060 gaming X from guru3d:  
http://www.guru3d.com/articles_pages/msi_geforce_gtx_1060_gaming_x_review,39.html  
4501 vs 4657, the 1060 is 3.3% faster. You can argue that the guy who did this OC test raise voltage to 1.2, however, his system is much weaker than guru3d's which lower his score a little bit and there are people that can hit 1400 without adjust voltage (pcworld editor claimed this in another thread here).  
TL;DR a ~1400MHz RX 480 is neck to neck with a 2100 GTX 1060 and it's not hard for them to reach that.     "

Don't say it's the partners fault either, msi/asus/gigabyte/zotac work with both companies and from the looks of it, they're the same coolers on both brands cards so why are nvidia the only ones pushing out cards?

When the 480 came out, i was like: wow, so much performance, for such a price. But AMD as well as nvidia did react and reduced the prices for old cards. Thus the 980Ti and Fury dropped in price.

-how much faster is the Fury in Vulkan or DX12?
-Is it worth it to pay 30€ extra for a fury with less RAM?

I was supposedly sent a broken [Sapphire RX480 8GB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202221) and so I sent it back requesting a REPLACEMENT. However, Newegg did not have any in stock, so they refunded it instead. All well, but they gave me a 20$ coupon if I bought that specific RX480 to cover for 2 day shipping costs for the inconvenience. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I know that the 2 day shipping could be canceled out if, of course, the Sapphire RX480 isn't restocked for another week...in which case, buying a video card now, which would take a week, would come in before the RX480 I want is even restocked. In this case, however, GTX 1060s are also out of stock (according to Nowinstock) and R9 390s are too much money (I spent all the money I had building my PC and barely got away with 5$ after buying the 240$ RX480).

&amp;nbsp;

I've been checking the Newegg link every few hours and Nowinstock has not updated to show any RX480s being stocked recently, excluding XFX versions. I'm not familiar with all of this because I am just switching over to PC, and I don't know how much any of you who take the time to answer will even know, but it's worth a shot.

&amp;nbsp;

TL;DR: When will [Sapphire RX480 8GBs](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814202221) be restocked? I was given a 20$ coupon to cover 2 day shipping for the inconvenience of buying a broken one when they first came out. "

Amd,Todesfaelle,4,0,"HIS RX 480 Reference For $334.99 CADSeems like Memoryexpress just picked up a shipment of 8 HIS cards with $8.99 shpping. It's still marked up but not nearly as bad as most other Canadian retailers.

[Link](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX62961)

~~Something to be aware of is that HIS will charge you ~$40-50 **BOTH WAYS** in the event that you need to RMA the card to HK but if that doesn't bother you then you may as well get in on likely the best current deal in Canada.~~

[MemoryExpress Warranty](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/MX62961/Warranty):
All NEW Items carry a one (1) year limited warranty, unless otherwise specified. Refurbished Clearance items carry a sixty (60) day limited warranty and all other clearance items carry a one (1) year limited warranty unless otherwise specified.

[HIS RMA](http://www.hisdigital.com/ca/support-32.shtml):
User need to bear the followings charge :

* Returning freight cost from HK to your postal address.
* Cost will be around US$50 to US$60 through courier such as TNT or Fedex depends on the regional.
* Optional for the insurance : Add US$1 or 2 only.
* Cheaper return cost will be available through post office service. It will be around US$39 to US$49 depend on the regional.
* Payment can be made through Credit Card by filling our Credit Card Authorization Form.

So it looks like after your limited one year ME warranty dries up you're then expected to pay up to $50USD to RMA your card to HK for the remaining year of the HIS warranty if I am understanding this correctly.

Edit: HIS has a two year baseline warranty"
Amd,explainFeels,57,74,"Good news for Gears of War 4Digital Foundry: Followers of the UE4 blog might note certain additions specific to Xbox over the past year - might we be able to expect some of those for Gears 4 (or even added because of Gears development)? For example,. async compute for reflection environment and SSAO passes, distance field shadowing/AO etc...

Mike Rayner: Yes, we are leveraging async compute heavily with Gears 4 - for SSAO and for reflection environment apply passes to confirm a few. We adopted async compute early on and learned how to extract significant gains from it. It's designed to allow for squeezing the last bits of performance out of the GPU and that it does well, when applied right.



TL;DR: Looks like the developers are taking good advantage of async compute.

Samsung k4g80325fb-hc25

[GTX 1070](https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_1070/4.html)

[RX 480](http://i.imgur.com/3B3naSU.jpg)

The 1070 achieved a +250MHz OC on their 256bit GDDR5 memory system. 

The 480 should perform similarly.

###DRIVERS

 Most of the leaks are running on 16.5.2 driver version. If you take Tonga, double the ROPS, add 256 cores, clock it about 25% higher, and add a small boost due to a faster cache, the leaks basically reflect that.

What it does not reflect is literally any of the new logic hardware in Polaris. That discard accelerator doesn't run itself. It is operated by driver code which does not exist at all in current AMD drivers.

The launch drivers in reviewers hands right now, 16.6.2, are just the first draft of support for the new features of the architecture, and I don't think it would be that surprising if performance in some areas improved in excess of 10%.

A 10% higher FSU score based on arch improvements. Plus a 20% OC from 1266 -&gt; ~1500 on the GPU and the known 12.5% OC on the VRAM. This alone puts the card at Fury X.

Why would production drivers out in public have beta driver code for an unreleased product? It just doesn't go in the build. There is no optimization or hardware support for Polaris right now in the leaks, since the reviewers just got that missing code in the new press drivers less than 24 hours ago. 

I just don't see an AMD developer leaking it. And since all the leaks are right around the same level, differing in 1080 base vs 1266 boost clocks it seems, it is even more unlikely that one guy leaked it to multiple people with different builds. Occam's Razor, 480 drivers didn't leak.

One option is that the 'Zen chipset' is the general AM4 chipset that will also support Bristol Ridge, in which case Bristol Ridge AM4 won't appear until Zen, at which point it will look like a decidedly bad offering by comparison.

The other option is that Bristol Ridge AM4 comes earlier, with its own AM4 chipset that won't support Zen, which will kill the entire idea of sharing a socket and will make it not worth getting due to lack of an upgrade path.

Either way, seems to me like, sadly, Bristol Ridge AM4 will be another dead in the water AMD product.

This 1080/1070 prices are wayyyyyyyy too much compared to the 980/970, so I was hoping to make the move back to amd, for a more honest company.

Question is, is there any knowledge/info on the 490/490x? I would assume it would be on par with a 1070/1080, for a fraction of the price. Good old amd."

Amd,slb97,6,0,"RX 480 performance speculation and expectations!I'm sure we all saw when AMD themselves compared the 480 to the 1080 in which crossfire 480s were beating a 1080, with room to spare. Know that multi-gpu doesn't scale 100% aswell, what I make of that is the 480 being at GTX 980 performance as a minimum, and would most likely be slightly faster in dx12.

Even disregarding the overclocking rumors, I don't see how this will be anywhere near a 390 in terms of performance, and I don't understand why people are expecting 390 when it's been clearly established they are aiming for gtx 980 minimum by comparing it with Nvidia's latest and greatest.

Now given that the overclocking rumors are excessive, it gets 100mhz faster by the day. There could be some merit to ""significant overclocks"", AMD could have just as easily said ""100 - 250 dollars"" and still have wiggle room with the 8gb model. If aftermarket 8gb models are approaching $300, an excessive $70 increase (30% higher!) then it should serve some purpose surely, right? That leads me to believe that 1550mhz is achievable, its a 22% OC from the 1266 base after all. Maxwell clocked even higher than that on 28nm. Pascal is routinely achieving 20% (2.1ghz from 1.6ghz) and its still seen as disappointing in some cases, I know I was hoping to see several 2.25ghz+ overclocks.

Going by AdoredTV's video, he does say at 1600mhz it will be competitive with a titan x in dx12. Obviously 1600mhz is a lot, but would you pay $70 extra for 1400mhz? That's only 10% of a boost and it loses its significant value advantage if that plays out to be true.  

IMO, the 480 will be a flop if it doesn't deliver 390x/980 level performance. I feel like many people are saying 390/970 level performance to downplay expectations, which is fine but I'm certain if its at this level of performance it will be disappointing for many. Any graphics card purchase should just be buying the best graphics card in your budget range, be it AMD, Nvidia, 3DFX or whatever. Many people defended the lackluster Fury X simply out of brand loyalty, quite stupid imo.

If AMD have the best in many peoples' budget then I'm sure this will do extremely well. It will be interesting to see how Nvidia respond to this by either lowering prices or bringing out a 1060, maybe even taking away from their own 1070 sales if the 480 turns out to be very good (although at that point I'm sure they will just drop prices of the 1070), forcing a pricing restructure like with the GTX 200 series. 

Let me know what you guys think and expect out of this card! Would be interesting to see others' opinions on this."

2) My R9 280 has the same performances.

4) Why AMD gives a RX 480 to a random ? And he doesn't respect the NDA.

5) If the RX 480 has this performances the CFX of the RX 480 is +100% better and a CFX or a SLI can't do +100% better.

Amd,SyntheticMoJo,30,4,"Monitor to pair with RX 480Hello folks!

I've been using an really old Rig till now: Radeon HD 6670 + AMD Athlon II X4 640. And I will go for a completely new PC with the RX 480 as it's centerpiece.

Well my monitor is even older 19"" 75 Hz that isn't even widescreen. 

So it would be only logical to upgrade the Monitor together with my PC. I heard from several people that they also upgrade at least GPU + Monitor together. I thought r/amd would be a great place to discuss what Monitor you want to pair with your RX 480.

**So what Monitor will you get for your new GPU?**
*What would you say is the best monitor to couple with the 480?*


- I think 4k is out of discussion because you will get unsatisfying FPS or need to tune down the graphics.


- So that means 1080p or 1440p.
You will probably be able to max out everything on a 1080p Screen and still get 75+ FPS with our new gift from AMD.


- Freesync sounds like a good combination with any AMD GPU but do you really need freesync if you are staying over 60 FPS the whole time?  

- Bigger is not always better: 27"" is just to big for 1080p and is often a little to big for any for of serious/competitive gaming imho. I prefer 22"" especially because I'm sitting rather near my TFT. What do you prefer?

- TN vs. IPS? Is Ghosting still a problem with IPS? I would take the great colors of IPS over any input delay-reduction that I won't notice.


I would like to be glad to hear your opinion and maybe we could sort out some great choices for some typical combinations for other people that also need a new friend for their 480."

Amd,mennydrives,5,0,"I hope AMD goes for for the throat in both markets[](/cheekyvs)I have an Nvidia GPU in my desktop, and it's probably gonna stay that way come 1080. Realistically, it's going to handle 4K/VR 'n Blender GPU rendering better at its price range than anything AMD will have out for a *while* (Q3 Vega is still mostly rumor). It doesn't help that they also happen to be more reliable for hardware-accelerated Steam streaming. I briefly flirted with an R9 Nano, but unfortunately it didn't hit the numbers I wanted. And I've got two i7s and an i5 to boot, mostly because they [land on a level in the CPU hierarchy that AMD hasn't been to in half a decade](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312.html), sadly.

[](/sp)[](/happyderp)With all that in mind, I've also got a PS4 'n a Wii U, and I'll probably have both consoles' immediate successors by summer of next year, so I've got a non-trivial interest in seeing what AMD gets out the door this year. On top of that, I have no delusions about why things are so nice on the side of the fence I'm standing on: Nvidia 'n Intel have been busting their cheeks to ""keep up with the Joneses"".

[](/sp)[](/ajlol)A world without AMD and Intel's flagship chip would look more like the Pentium IV than the current Core architecture, or (shudder) Itanium, and that 1080 would probably be a thousand dollar chip in a world without Polaris.

AMD does everything I want both architecturally and ethically, and basically the only thing keeping me off them is *timing*; that the moment, they just happen to be laser-focused on a market that I'm unfortunately not a part of.

Amd,onotech,60,17,"Hey guys, so I did a theoretical calculation of Polaris' and Vega's performanceWhat's up guys? It's time for another one of my theoretical calculation threads. I decided to this one because [my calculation of the 480X's performance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/4knxmr/exclusive_amd_radeon_r9_480_based_on_polaris_10/d3gdlad) was very, very close to the 3DMark scores that released (though they are not really confirmed yet).


**Of course, like always, this is theoretical and speculation**, so do not take it seriously. I did use math but I didn't take into account OC'ing ability, stock &amp; memory clocks, voltage, shader count, tessellation, and other things. It's based on 3DMark scores.


[Like always, I have a video version if you don't want to read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TLwiLfrpOU&amp;ab_channel=OzTalksHW)


Alright, now time for the calculation.

-------------------------------------------

Let's assume the rumors are true. The 380X has a TDP of 190W and the 480X is assumed to be 130W. Now, AMD claims 2.5X perf/watt, but that's best case scenario and silicon does not scale linearly either. Let's assume 2.25.


Now, the 380X has a 3D Mark Firestrike score of 13,300 ish. Assuming the 480X had a TDP of 190W, its score would 30,060 (using the 2.25 perf/watt), but its supposed TDP is 130W.


Now, 190/130 is 1.462.


Divide that 30,060 by 1.462 and you get roughly 20,560. That's almost 2000 points ahead of a reference 980 and 390X.

-------------------------------------------

Do this for all of them:

R9 490X: 30,567 (Assumed 200W TDP)

R9 490: 28,685 (Assumed 200W TDP)

R9 480X: 20,060 (Assumed 130W TDP

R9 480: 16,811 (Assumed 120W TDP)

R9/R7 470: 8335 (Assumed 50W TDP)

-------------------------------------------

FINAL LIST:

R9 490X - 30,567

R9 490 - 28,685

GTX 1080 - 27,700

R9 295X2 - 26,310

GTX 980 Ti - 24,550

R9 480X - 20,060

R9 390X - 18,700

GTX 980 - 18,500

R9 390 - 17,700

R9 480 - 16,811

GTX 970 - 15,730

R9 380X - 13,360

R9/R7 470 - 8335 (weirdly similar to 270 and 370, so probably a discrepancy)


Yeah, so that's what happened when I attempted to math this all out. Of course, we still do not have confirmation from AMD themselves as to which is Vega and which is Polaris, but I hope the Macau unveils a bit more.

----------------------
/u/PhoBoChai brought to my attention that Vega is higher than 2.5X perf/watt according to the GPU road map. Let's assume 3X


490X - 40,756

490 - 38,247

It seems way high, so I'm sure my formula may not work for Vega, but there it is."

Amd,TheAlbinoAmigo,176,216,"It's good to not set expectations unrealistically high for Polaris - but can people please stop stating that P10 *will* be 390(X) performance as a fact, too?Whenever I see people on here hyping up Polaris' performance, I immediately see quite a few people stating something to the effect of:

&gt;AMD has already said P10 will offer 390-390X performance.......

This isn't true. AMD simply hasn't said *anything* about absolute performance for either Polaris chip - we've just had two fairly ambiguous demos (P11 SWBF Medium@60, P10 Hitman ???@60). The only other indicator we've had is that AMD had said Polaris will fill their mainstream segments - but since we don't *know* what the performance increase from 14nm FF actually is at this point, nor do we know much about clocks/IPC improvements from architecture optimisations, that doesn't actually mean much to us objectively speaking.

Wait for the reveal, then most importantly **wait for benchmarks** before stating that Polaris 'will' have X/Y/Z performance!

E: Perhaps I should correct myself, when I say they haven't offered any info on absolute performance, I mis-spoke slightly. They've said they want to increase the TAM for VR, which means with fairly strong certainty that Polaris will offer at LEAST 290-level performance, but that's only a lower bound, performance could be anywhere upwards of there potentially.

E: some people seem to be missing the point I'm making - I'm not saying P10 won't be as fast as Fury(X), or may struggle to reach 390(X) - I kind of expect it to be between the two myself - what I am saying is that **nobody** knows for sure, so don't go around telling people 'AMD said it will have 390 performance' when they haven't done!

Okay i have been looking at this a lot since i got my R9 380, (had 6970 before).
And it has really been a pain as i noticed a lot of games i play use OpenGL.
 
 
So for those who aren't familiar with this, what's the problem?
 
 
Well apparently there is an issue in either the Architecture or Drivers.
The issue is that if you Capture a fast way like OBS normally do you will get corrupted frames.
Here is a video (Not mine): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dpD0ftaNW0
I experience the same issue, the Performance is good like what you would expect, but the result is as you can see.
 
 
Now the Solution is to do a slower method that i assume all other Software normally use, and with that you will get no artifacts but the performance goes down A Lot.
 
 
Borrowing a quote for the solution on OBS MP:
&lt;Osiris&gt; multi-adapter compatibility causes frames to be copied to system memory, hence the lesser performance
Now i have been asking about this, but nobody really seems to mind that the problem is huge. I know the ""OpenGL Capture Community"" probably is kinda small, but still, the R9 series should be well spread enough.
 
 
Now how huge is the Drop, well in Amnesia in the Start Menu, let's say i have 200fps at 1080p, capturing that would go down below 60.
 
 
And yes this is not some Codec issue taking performance etc.
Tried many different softwares and it's all the same, it all points to this problem which for some reason is not well known.
 
 
I would like to get some kind of Answer from AMD about it, cause even though i know a fix is probably not happening, maybe some faint explanation.
 
 
I would love if this could be fixed with a Driver, but looking how many drivers been released and this issue isn't even mentioned at all, i very much doubt it.
 
 
Here are two Images to make a comparison of the FPS drop more ""easy"".
Though it's kinda unfair to do screenshots of it, but it's just to show the deal.
 
 
Here is the Video (Heavily compressed cause no reason to waste space): https://fs10n5.sendspace.com/dl/ea5f596ba6dfe46e1d2142bd0214ba5d/56d9324a116e01d9/9iuqsu/2016-03-04%2007-50-30.mkv

EDIT: The FPS is misleading cause it counts OBS as well, hence why it flickers to D3D11 at times (check the video).
However the drop is what matters and it's still Huge.

EDIT 2: The video file link doesn't work, sadly i don't have it on my PC, basically it just showed what the Youtube video does, and what the images show."

&gt;We don't have a card yet, and we aren't getting one. Almost as if a repeat of the R9 Nano PR trainwreck, there is a surreal celebration of cluelessness among AMD and its marketing partners responsible for Germany. Last week, we asked AMD's German PR agency on what the plan was regarding sampling and scheduling and received a ""no idea on timing."" We also checked with AMD, and they didn't know either, giving us a ""will keep you updated"" response. We've been reviewing Radeons for over a decade now, and if AMD does not want something to be reviewed, a ""no"" goes over better than flat-out denying the very existence of an upcoming product's launch (one that has already seen a paper-launch).

Perhaps it has to do with the majority of GameWorks titles on his test bench suite (and excluding AMD backed games like AoTS, Hitman DX12) or that their - newseditor in chief is an nvidia fanboy. He goes on to say:

&gt;There's a reason why our test-bench consists of such a vast diversity of games and game-engines.

Amd,OrSpeeder,142,0,"Stop hyping DX12, stop begging for more DX12 games, please understand how bad idea it is!AMD made some really awesome work with Mantle, that got re-used in Vulkan and DX12.

Vulkan is not ready yet, we have only two Vulkan releases I think (Doom, that actually doesn't work with Vulkan yet, and Dota 2, that is quite buggy and Vulkan is purely Beta).

So, the few new games using Mantle-style tech are using DX12.

I understand that it is exciting how good performance it has, but DX12 is a terrible proposition for us, it make the industry too vulnerable to Microsoft sheigans.

If you pay attention to Microsoft news, you will find out they are attempting to make a plan they called ""Windows Everywhere"", where the objective is make Windows 10 work in multiple platforms, from PCs and consoles, to phones, and ""Internet of Things"" devices.

Then the next step, is make their grip tighter and tighter until all apps must come from Win10 store, like it is happening right now on OSX.

----

Explanation on OSX situation: By default, installing any app that didn't came from the store is an annoyance, beside having to muck around with settings and clicking OK in various scary warning boxes, Apple is each version of OSX disabling some stuff third party apps needed, for example in the most recent version they made impossible to install some common Unix stuff (and OSX has an official Unix certification) on common Unix folders, breaking cross-platform Unix apps. (most notoriously OpenMotif and anything that uses it).

Because installing stuff is a pain, even if ""possible"", people don't offer stuff anymore outside of App Store, if you want to use certain applications, you have to create a App Store account with Credit Card, follow Apple rules, whatnot (and similarly, app makers have to pay 30% to Apple).

---

If we keep harping for DX12, MS will use this situation to point to people that they need Win10 (instead of older versions) because of DX12, then they will ""start"" making moves to force people to use their store like it happened on OSX.


The ""start"" here, is because actually they already started, for example by removing a feature that could be used to block Win10 store on small business, now small business are forced to let their employees install random crap from Win10 store.

Also they are overhauling the update system, and soon might move it in the Win10 store, like Apple Store, and thus to have updates you will be obliged to use it too.

So in short, don't beg for DX12 games, instead ask for AMD to finish fast their Vulkan stuff, and help devs make awesome Vulkan games, and advertise all of AMD Async power with Vulkan, and show the great capabilities of GCN Mantle tech inherited by Vulkan with Vulkan.

---

EDIT: 

I got many replies of people thinking my problem with DX12 is technical, performance, whatever.

Also, got many replies of people thinking I don't want any DX12 games at all, or that I am anti-Windows.

My concern here, is purely one from the business standpoint, DX12 is a great API, and devs that want to use it for that reason, should do so, of course, also AMD of course should continue improving their DX12 drivers.

Still, I am seeing lots of people excited with DX12 performance, and begging in various places for more DX12 games, and DX12 drivers, and whatnot, without ever referencing Vulkan, Mantle, etc...

The problem with this is that the ones that make the decisions, the executives and publishers, that don't necessarily know anything about the actual development, might decide for marketing/PR reasons to force their devs to make DX12 only games to make the DX12 fans happy, and make the market vulnerable to Microsoft sheigans.

I am not telling people to avoid DX12, or to be anti-Windows, pro-Linux or anti-Microsoft, I am asking the enthusiat community to pay attention to Vulkan, help AMD debug Vulkan drivers, ask devs to add Vulkan-based renderer, and so on, devs will still be able to later port to DX12, but with a healthy Vulkan ecosystem that has participation of the players, Vulkan will be able to avoid OpenGL sad fate, and become a good open API, that all devs and platforms can use.

This applies to many things, not only Vulkan vs DX12, this also applies to OpenAL vs WWise (sadly AMD is on the wrong side here, supporting WWise with TrueAudio), OpenVR vs Oculus Rift (read about Oculus preventing people using legally purchased games from Oculus store with Vive for example), CUDA vs OpenCL, Gameworks vs GPUOpen, MP3 vs Ogg, GIF vs PNG, Flash vs HTML5, etc...."

[I've taken first place for Firestrike Extreme with a Fury X on the official 3Dmark rankings.](http://www.3dmark.com/search#/?mode=basic&amp;url=/proxycon/ajax/search/gpuname/fs/X/AMD%20Radeon%20R9%20Fury&amp;gpuName=AMD%20Radeon%20R9%20Fury)

[I also managed 21st in Firestrike Extreme on HWbot.](http://hwbot.org/submission/3196638_)

The scores still need a lot of work and there is some further fine tuning I plan to do on the cards. If all goes well I may do another 3 way livestream either on Wednesday or Saturday. I'm considering trying to push myslef up into the 3Dmark 3 GPU Firestrike Extreme and Firestrike Hall of Fame which I shouldn't have too much of a problem doing.

Either way so far I've had fun with overclocking the Fury Xs so far and plan to push them further. I also wish I had a fourth one because then I could beat [this score](http://www.3dmark.com/fs/5551924)."

I planned on gaming using Steam's In-Home streaming from my main PC.  However, even on a hard wired connection, I felt like there was input lag, and gaming like that just didn't feel right.

The R7 graphics that the 7850k runs are actually pretty impressive for an on-board processor... but still I'm looking to get a little more out of it, so I'm thinking about adding a new video card.  Here's where I'd like your insight:

1)  Would an R9 380x or 390 be a good choice for my current setup?  Will there be bottlenecks?

2)  Is it worth it to get one of those cards within the next couple of months?  Should I wait it out and get one of the new 400 series cards when they're released?

They have a certified refurbished from manufacturer R9 290 for $190, but they also have an open box 390 for $260-$270.  
Originally I was sticking with Nvidia because I use a Hackintosh. And then I realized, I don't even play games or render anything in OSX, so why not just use my Intel HD4600 for my Hackintosh and have a separate HDMI to my graphics card for Windows so I can use that for gaming?  
Plus the R9 *does* work in OSX some times, but even if it doesn't, I can still use the first plan.  
The question is, I see a lot of people saying to just wait for Polaris, but I feel like I can get a deal that's good enough on an R9 390, that should I really wait?  
I play Fallout 4, I'm going to buy GTA V again.  
Also, is it not worth the price jump from the R9 390 to something better? They also have a 295x2 for $400, an open box 390x for $339 and a Fury Nano for around $400.

Amd,xamaryllix,7,0,"My R9 290 runs hot in my RVZ02Hello everyone, looking for some advice here.

I downsized my PC case from the massive Fractal Design R4 to the sleek and sexy Silverstone RVZ02.  This change took a lot of getting used to, and the biggest hurdle so far has probably been keeping my components cool.

In the huge R4 case that had something like 5 fans and room for cable management, my i5 and R9 290 ran cool as cucumbers.  Now in my cramped RVZ02 case that has no room and **no fans**, my parts get *way* toastier.  Still technically within normal operating range to my knowledge, never exceeding 80C, but I still don't feel comfortable with my R9 290 staying that hot for long when I binge on Dark Souls III.

So now I have a few options and I'm not sure what to do:

- Adjust to the massive heat radiating from under my desk. and wait for Polaris 10.
- Sell 290 and buy 390, which should run cooler with lower TDP.
- Sell 290 and buy GTX 950 as a stopgap while waiting for Polaris 10.

Amd,johanneszab,30,92,"Thank you AMD for your Open Source Linux Driver effort!Over the weekend I've finally tried out amdgpu and the installation was much easier than i thought.

I'm aware that the driver is completely new and everything is still greatly improving, but even though, all I've had to do was basically get the newest kernel (4.6.0-0.rc0.git7.2.vanilla.knurd.1.fc23.x86_64) for dynamic clocking for my fedora from its vanilla-mainline repo using a single command.
Installing steam was another single command. 

In total, I'm now playing CIV5 on my Sapphire R9 380 at 1080p in High Quality and the fans don't even raise much from it's completely off state in the desktop environment. My CPU fan (be quiet! Dark Rock 3) is at about the same noise level during gameplay.
And yes, I'm aware that CIV5 is quite old and not an FPS, but even though from my understanding with driver releases it has become quite a hassle for the manufacturers. Most of the huge windows driver package must be performance fixes for almost every PC game out there and porting those to linux might probably never happen. 

Anyways, when I'm thinking back installing a binary linux graphics driver (nvidia or amd), it was always a mess with upgrading the kernel. Often the TTYs didn't work, graphics errors during screen switches (from console to X11, or suspend) other glitches and often old dependencies. 
Now, everything is done using the package manager, just like everything else under linux. Large parts are included in kernel updates and everything is open source and always there. No more legacy driver for older hardware which won't work with more recent distributions, that's just great.

I've had my AMD R9 390 for about a month or two now, I constantly can hold 50 frames per second in the vast majority of the games I play on a daily basis with the settings usually on Medium to High with various tweaks here and there. I only play at 1080p but even at 4k the framerate will not change.

My current build and driver version is:
AMD R9 390
AMD FX 8350
Corsair 16GB RAM
Two WD Black 1TB HDDs
ASUS M5A99FX PRO R2.0 Motherboard
750w Modular Corsair PSU

My driver version is now on the latest 16.4.2 but these issues have plagues me since the card was first bought a few versions back. The clock speed only seems to be at either 300mhz on idle or 1000 Mhz with no middle ground.

Is there something up with the Crimson drivers for this card or is the problem completely someplace else?


Much obliged."

Or hold out for HMB 2.0?Basically, I've been playing the Division.. and it runs HORRIBLY on my AMD card.. various glitches.. from flickering walls to Assassins creed level Animus white surroundings that blind me.  Now these problems are either caused by it being an Ubisoft game, the fact that I'm using a 2009 HD5870, or a combination of both.

Now I originally intended to hold out for HMB 2.0, but since AMD decided to drop driver support for the 5000 series, the game I want to play being buggy as all hell, and HMB being (I believe) pushed back to sometime in 2017, my hand is kinda being forced.

So now I have to make the choice of doing some kind of cheaper temporary upgrade from a HD5870 to something else while I wait for HMB 2.0 stuff in 2017, or getting something 'big' now and using that until around 2021.

I figure I'd come get an opinion on the matter from people more informed than me on what is going on in the industry.   It looks like I may end up getting a GTX 950 (or an AMD equivalent) while I wait for 2017~

Is this being caused because the game is badly optimized, or is the 390 still not enough?"

Amd,Brodazzler,24,6,"Upgrading to a (1440p?)Freesync IPS Monitor for a R9 390x, no idea if I should go 60hz or 144hzI am a pretty casual gamer, used to be more competitive but recent tendinitis issues and a new job have put an end to that(Please perform daily hand exercises people). I am running a new build on an old 1600x900 monitor and I think it's time I upgrade. From what I've read I am most definitely going with a Freesync enabled monitor and since I will be playing mostly newer single player games as they come out(aside from the occasional bout of Planetside and League with old friends) I figured a 1440p 60hz Freesync with an IPS panel would serve me well. However I am finding conflicting opinions on the r9 390(X)'s performance with 1440p, some saying utilizing 60-90hz is a pipe dream for the card, others that say 144hz is easily attainable. The general consensus seems to be that the card can run 1440p(correct me if I am wrong) with few hiccups and knowing my rig currently does not hit a consistent 60 FPS with AAA games at Ultra I think 60hz would be sufficient, especially considering the lack of 1440p 144hz Freesync IPS Panels on the market at the moment. I also see a lot of people saying that FPS is so much better than Resolution, leading me to consider 1080p 144hz, but it seems that Freesync does a lot to age this opinion, especially considering the type of gaming I will, for the most part, be doing. I can also see the argument made for the Asus MG279Q, being that there is an off chance the card hits 90-144 FPS and the 35-90hz range on the freesync would be great for the newer AAA titles, resulting in a best of both worlds scenario making me lean towards this specific monitor but I'm not 100% sure I am looking at this in the right light, hence the post. 

TL;DR: Freesync IPS for a 390x: 1440p 60hz, 1440p 144hz or scrap the 1440p dream and go for 1080p 144hz?

Well the thing that bugs me is I only have 7 months of warranty left on R9 280x otherwise I would not think of replacing,the transition from selling R9 280x and buying MSI Armour R9 380 2 GB would be 7 $ and R9 380 has 3 years of warranty and decent cooling.

Also R9 380 has better support,tesselation,full DX 12 support,lower power consumption and due to better color compression 2 GB of VRAM is more or less same as 3 GB on Tahiti chip.

After digging around for a few hours today on Google (and finding nothing) and also in ASRock's UEFI, I found that overclocking the iGPU to 918 MHz (from 866 MHz) fixed the problem. Resetting the iGPU clock at Auto or 866 MHz brought back the driver crashes. Can anyone provide a reasonable explanation for why this works?

Amd,catpatat,12,16,"GPUs with ""Impeller"" cooling solutionHey guys,
I currently have the HIS 280 IceQ (not the X² version). It uses a cooling design where the fan sucks air in at the end of the card and exhausts it through the expansion slot grills (probably a lot like the reference designs that AMD and Nvidia provide). This has been working like a charm for me, the fan is barely audible even with the GPU currently running at 100% (at around 72°) to power TW: Attila at full settings at 1080p.

I really like the cooling setup and I was wondering, as I am thinking about upgrading to the likes of a 390 or a 970, if there are any cards that use this kind of cooling solution (I couldn't find any, not even from HIS).

Secondly, why has this design apparently fallen out of favor? Every card I see uses basically the same ""blow air over the whole card and use the case fans to exhaust it""...

4.2.0

So I've got an aftermarket cooler, an [Arctic Cooling Accelero Twin Turbo 6990](https://www.arctic.ac/us_en/accelero-twin-turbo-6990.html). It's got two fans and a big ass block of copper.

For testing purposes, I have set a fairly aggressive can RPM curve in MSI Afterburner, to the point that it actually should be 100% for any temp above 0c. However the fan speed being reported is 20% (not really a curve anymore is it? More of a line).

I read a bit about how there was a bug in the first version of the driver included with Crimson that was locking fan speeds at 20%, but I thought they had that fixed?

If I turn on manual fan control in Afterburner, and drag the bar up to 100%, the moment I click ""apply"", it sets it back down to 20%.

What do I do next?

EDIT:

There's some other weirdness going on it looks like. It the expanded histogram on the right panel of Afterburner, the graph shows the GPU 1 fan speed is 100%, however the sidebar controller still says 20%. I'm not sure why that is... My [Laser Tachometer](http://www.vxb.com/LCD-Digital-Photo-Laser-Tachometer-Non-Tach-RPM-p/Kit8908.htm?gclid=CO2b767n4csCFQUFaQodHgMKaw) is reporting about 1500 RPMs on the primary fan, but about 315 to 340 RPM on the second fan... which corisponds to the Afterburner read out that says GPU 2 is at 20%, on the histogram... I can't find any controls to turn up the fan speed on Fan 2, and it's running about ten degrees hotter than GPU 1 is. (It's a single card if that wasn't clear, dual GPUs.)"

It was in this time that I aquired 1000 hours in gmod. I self taught myself about computers (apparently not good enough, as you'll read later) and got myself a base PC from Best Buy to work with in 2012. It had integrated graphics as well, but it was running on an intel i5, so it was a bit better than my laptop. It was missing something though. In 2013, I got my first actual upgrade for my computer. It was a new power supply and a graphics card (GTX 650 ti) I remember it was first brought to it's knees when space engineers came out. Now fast forward to January 2016. My ol' rig was acting up after buying a second hand 570. The 570 was perfect, however something was afoot. games would randomly blackscreen and my monitor would say ""no signal"". I thought to myself, and, after doing some math that only Albert Einstein himself could solve, I determined that I was missing about 50 watts required to successfully power the GPU. OK, no problem. I buy a shitty 600w power supply as a test for that. Still blackscreened,  So I took it back. I held onto the $60 for a rainy (Radey) day. So I buy a hyper 212 EVO because my cpu was running hot. Nope. So after realizing that I can't be fucking bothered with this thing anymore, and realizing that i've accumulated about $800 from working so far, I go to cyberpowerpc.com. Now I know it's written in the 10 PC commandments that ""thou shall not buy a pre-built."" I didn't trust myself after all of the previous occurrences. So I placed the order. It had an intel core i5 2500k and a GTX 950 in it. They sat on the order for three weeks before I called to cancel, which went through very quickly, makes me think they hadn't even ordered the parts yet. Anyways, fuck buying direct from them is all I have to say about cyberpower. So after the charges have been refunded to my account, I go on Best Buy's website and find a PC. Now, i've had no previous knowledge of AMD. I knew what was a good GPU and what was bad, but that's it. I looked up the FX 8320, and I found out that it's pretty good. The PC I got was $700. It has an R7 250, an AMD FX 8320 and 16 gigs of ram. I couldn't be happier with my purchase! My only three upgrades currently planned are the H110i GT that somebody recommended , the R9380, and a 700w power supply. Also I should mention that one of the biggest things is the software. AMD's is so much more user friendly and better looking than Geforce Experience.

I have contacted AMD multiple times in the proximate 2 years i have had the card, but to no avail.

The latest title I have struggled with is Fallout 4. Not have AMD not prepared the driver and crossfire support for the title in any way, but even after waiting for the crossfire profile and driver tweak to arrive I still experience unplayable stuttering in Fallout 4 and other titles in both windowed and fullscreen with both v-sync turned on and off.

AMD seems to have somehow acknowledged that something isn't right with their Fallout 4 driver hotfix:

So I will likely be replacing my Nvidia 760 this summer when Pascal comes out, but I've been researching Nvidia's anticompetitive business practices and now I'm kinda interested in getting something from AMD.

I understand that if I were to switch, I would no longer be able to use Shadowplay so I'd have to switch to OBS, which is a huge pain in the ass to use and I've also had problems of it not recording when I tell it to. 

I would also be unable to use CUDA in my NLE, and because of that I'd probably have to rely on my i7 to render videos.

So I don't know if it's worth risking both of these things just so I can get better performance for the same price and also not support shady business practices.

EDIT: Actually, I might just stay with Nvidia. Right now I really don't see any huge problem that will force me to switch to AMD, unless something goes very wrong with the release of the GTX 1070. If that's the case I will likely get an AMD card.

Amd,segaboy81,43,0,"Extreme 8370 build regrets.Hi! I just built IMO an awesome AMD rig. 

*Disclaimer:* I haven't built a gaming machine in many, many years. How many years? Well, the last gaming rig I built was a AMD K6-2 with a Riva TNT graphics card circa 1999/2000.

I've always been involved with computers. I am a Linux system administrator and almost all of my experience outside of work involves mid-range machines that I've built. For desktop computer, you don't need much... :)

So, preparing for this build took a LOT of research. Here it is;

Antec P50 micro ATX case
AMD FX 8370 /w Corsair H80i water cooler
Radeon 380x
32GB RAM (I do a lot of virtualization)
Samsung EVO 256GB SSD
750w power supply

So, why the regret? Well, surprisingly it's not having Windows 10, though it is annoying to use. (this is the first time I've had Windows at home since the early 2000s.) Regret started last night when I learned the system requirements for the new Need for Speed game...

For 1080p, it wants a higher-end i5 (or equivalent). I did not realize from the outset that AMD hasn't really had anything new since 2013... All the 5th-gen/6th-gen i5s outpace these Piledriver CPUs. It also calls for a R9 290! I've learned that that card is quite a bit more snappy than my 380x. FML.

Also, while I feel like my CPU is pretty good, this is as good as it's going to get for AM3+ (like most people, I'm not interested in the 9590). There is no upgrade path for me...

So, what should I do? The total build w/tax cost $1055. Should I sell the build on eBay and start a new intel build? Or should I get another 380x, go crossfire, and overclock my CPU if needed (it's water-cooled). I've learned that with Crossfire, I can use any other R9 card, right?

**NOTE: THIS IS A BETA PATCH SO THE OFFICIAL PATCH MAY BE DIFFERENT**


Before I go any further let me list my specs:


XFX R9 390 8GB


AMD FX-8320 (4.0ghz overclock stable)


16gb of Kingston Fury HyperX Ram


not the best setup I know but its been great to me so far
now into what you all wanna know...what are my results.




Location | Patch 1.3 | Patch 1.3 tweaks | Patch 1.4 | Patch 1.4 Tweaks |
-----------|------------|----------------------|-------------|----------------------|
Sanctuary|35-40fps with deadzone 25fps| 45-50fps with deadspot at 37fps| 45-50fps dead drop to 35fps| 60fps dead drop to 47fps|
Walking into Red Rocket Station| 40fps 25fps drop| 30fps  then jump to 45fps| 33fps then jumps to 50fps| 45fps then back to 60fps|
Walking into Concord| Drop to 20fps| Drop to 26fps| Drop to 30fps| Drop to 40fps|
Inside Concord| 40-45fps|  40-50fps| 45-50fps| 55-60fps|
Outside Diamond City looking at the gate | 30fps| 35-37fps| 37-40fps| 44fps|
Inside DCM | 23fps| 30fps| 33fps| 35fps|
Inside Main Area of DCM| 40fps| 45fps| 50fps| 55-60fps|
Back of DCM| 50fps| 50-55fps| 55-60fps| 55-60fps|



So obviously some good improvements!


With the tweaks I found online its a lot easier to minimize the drops for a somewhat more stable experience!


Ill list the ones I used below as well as links to some threads for help


**TWEAKS/PROGRAMS I USED**


**Launcher Settings**


*everything ultra with godrays off, Shadow Quality medium, Shadow Distance medium, Lighting Quality medium. Set all the Distance stuff to 50% in advanced*


**Radeon PRO**


*in Radeon PRO I disabled Aero, ForceHighPriority, Vsync Always on, Tessellation 16x, FlipQueueSize 1, Texture Filtering Performance*


**ShadowBoost**


*installed with Target Framerate being 58 fps (Not sure if shadowboost worked as it doesn't have support for beta patches but I enabled it and ignored the warning to continue playing anyway)*


**ENBoost**


*Limit Framrate = True*


*60fps ya know the standard stuff for a beth game and then i set my VRAM accordingly*


**IniTweaks:**


*only one I enabled was iNumHWThreads=4*


*i used Bilago's Fallout 4 Config Launcher to set that*






So there you guys go! That's my somewhat analysis of the performance increase on AMD GPU's in the 1.4 beta patch. If there are some other places you'd like me to go test I'd be more than happy to do it and update it in a comment on this thread!

Amd,Python2k10,27,16,"Got a couple Corsair H55 AIOs and Kraken G10s to cool off my 290's. PRETTY FUCKING AWESOMENo pictures, because everything looks like shit (more info on that later) 

So basically, I have Crossfire 290's. All was well in the world, with both cards rarely cracking 80c at 1080p. Fast forward to a few days ago, and I got an Mg279q, which is a 1440p panel. AS IT TURNS OUT, 1440P IS A LOT OF FUCKING PIXELS. 

All of a sudden, both of my GPUs are being used at their absolute maximum. My top card started regularly throttling at 94c, and the bottom card was creeping up as well. I had two XFX Double Dissipation models. They just weren't working out in my H440. I tried everything I could. Popping off my front panel kinda helped, but not enough. So I decided on going the watercooling route.

INSTALLATION EXPERIENCE: 0/10

Fucking. Awful. Good lord, I had never done anything nearly as stressful in my fucking life. Jesus Christ. First things first, I had to maim one of my coolers. The fan cable that connected to the GPU itself did not want to come unplugged. At all. I ended up having to cut the cable, effectively ruining the cooler. Fuck. Oh well. 

Getting the screws to stay put was rather annoying. Very. Annoying. The worst part, by far, was lowering the pump and bracket into the screws. Cue several minutes of anger and it's finally on. I go to install it into my case. 

Aaaaaand it doesn't reach the front. The H55 has some short ass hoses. So now I have to redo my PC radiator and fan setup. I already had a Kraken x61 up top for my cpu (exhausting), a 140mm AF140 exhausting in the rear, and 3 Cougar Vortex 120mm fans in intaking from the front. All of it had to be changed. ALL OF IT. 

So I finally got the first card done and mounted. Moved the Kraken x61 up front, exhausting. I mounted the rad at the top rear as intake. Sounds stupid as fuck, but I wanted it to get fresh, colder air. Anyway, I turn on the PC to test it. Idle temps are.... The exact same. 40ish Celsius. Okay, I'm sure it's just getting settled. I load up Firestrike, aaaaaand it's immediately at 94c. wat

So I take the card out and retighten the bracket. I hear a crack and think I broke the PCB. Fuck. No visible damage, though, so I reinstall the card. Load it up. 30c idle. YES. Run Firestrike, doesn't break 50c. YEEES. 

SECOND CARD TIME. I go to remove the cooler, aaaaaand the fan won't unplug out of the card's fan slot. Much pulling and finger numbness later, I say fuck it and have to fucking cut the fan plug off the cooler. One useless cooler later, I get it installed (a bit easier this time) and go to mount it. Again, hose shortness is an issue. I have it in the rear as intake. I go to plug in the Pump power. No easy to reach fan header. Have to take out the card AGAIN to reach the one on the bottom of my case. Plug it in finally, get it installed. 

Boot up PC. Both cards idling at 30c. It is done. Roughly 5 hours after I started, I'm done. I put in two 120mm fans up top as exhaust. Probably a stupid fucking setup. Oh well. I put my panels on and play some Dying Light. This game caused me thermal throttling before. I check temps after a bit and see my top card at... 70c. I'm not running an OC at this point. I take the top panel off since it has INSANELY restrictive airflow. Temps immediately start dropping. By the time I quit, top card was at 58c and still dropping. 

It was done. Finally. No more thermal problems. I got two replacement 92mm fans for the G10 that are supposedly much better than the stock ones. Didn't check my VRM temps after gaming, but they idle at 28c. I have heatsink things coming in but I don't think I'm going to bother. I do not want to go through that shit again. 

So that's my experience. Was it difficult? Insanely. Was it worth it? Insanely. I'm probably gonna switch over to an Air 540 for better, non ridiculous rad placement since it's not as big length wise. I am running with my top panel off. I moved my front fan filter to the top (fits perfectly) since I'm no longer intaking from the front. 

No pics because it looks awful as shit. "
Amd,Alacratha,85,7,"Long winded rant, on the winds of change- Trying to convert and had a few questions, hopefully this isn't against the rules.**Hey there, sorry for the title or this post even if it's against your rules and such feel free to flag it and tell me I'm a pleb whom doesn't read rules, etc.   But I did have some honest questions since I'm looking to get past the GPU's I'm used to knowing and loving but.. I've been burned a bit too many times.**   
  


&gt; Started back with the GTX 480, which I swapped out with two GTX 580's and so on.. Which worked great till I began to start working on game design and begin playing more games rather than just being an enthusiast.
&gt; 
&gt; I fell into the hype, and got two GTX Titans, and thought about how great this double precision will be for my projects and rendering! Plus it's a solid candidate for gaming and rocking the casbah with that.
&gt; 
&gt; But then.. The GTX 780 Ti rolls around and honestly wrecks what I'm doing and the double precision I wanted so desperately to use.. was never even supported by my software. So I just kinda sat there festering, but kept reminding myself- ""Hey! I've got GTX Titans! The most powerful GPU in the world!""  
&gt;   
&gt; So I let myself go blindly into buying more Nvidia parts, now don't get me wrong, they were great cards- but watching it get ursuped by a card close to half the price at the time.. was heart breaking even in my denial.
&gt; 
&gt; So my computer gets destroyed by an Ex-Roommate, and I am forced to rebuild.. I decided to go ""Budget Friendly"" and went with a GTX 750 Ti, and an FX 4300.
&gt; 
&gt; Damn- did that machine sing, it was pretty capable, and it was the first time I had used an AMD CPU since my old Althon X2, it rendered videos great ( CUDA was also never working for me.. So another sting to Nvidia )  
&gt; 
&gt; So I decided to upgrade, switched to a GTX 970 and an FX 8350, and I was blown away at how much better my FPS got in things like FFXIV, or even rendering media like my music blasted right through it- but there was something still kinda irking me..
&gt; 
&gt; My GTX 970 had issues, whether it was in GTA V or some other games I wanted to play ( Despite it working flawlessly in FFXIV ) some of them, would just tank- So I thought to myself, ""Alright, well I want a bigger case- so I'll SLI! I can also give my 8350 to a friend help him join the PCMR!""  
&gt;   
&gt; Which then.. That cascaded into my actually getting a bit lower FPS in some areas on FFXIV my 8350 actually did better which was really odd to me. Also, that issue with GTA V and my SLI'd 970's now? Yeah. still present.  
&gt;   
&gt; So fast forward till now.. I've since sold or given away my 970's and gone with a 980 Ti to make a Mini ITX rig, but.. I wanted to get a Gsync Monitor since I had a bit more of a memory pool- And Jesus christ, these monitors? over 800 bucks for my PG278Q at the time! 
&gt; I thought to myself it'd be awesome to have it.. so I shelled out the cash while still wondering about the Freesync variant.. being 400 bucks on sale.
&gt; 
&gt; I kept thinking to myself having this tech would make me superior, make me bigoted, because I was rocking the sweetest setup with Gsync Monitors, and a liquid cooled 980 Ti- It's.. Disgusting, and I'm sorry for turning into that monster I was.  
&gt;   
&gt; I then began seeing things that were happening in FO4, or Witcher 3 where Nvidia was purposely gimping AMD GPU's and hell- even it's OWN LINEUP!
&gt; 
&gt; What the fuck Nvidia? My friends have 7970's and all sorts of other AMD GPU's and started only recently XFirin' them for more FPS, but jeez.. those things still hold up!
&gt; 
&gt; It got me to thinking- and as pissed off, and as burnt as I've been ( Albeit in an extreme first world problem sense ) with Nvidia, I want to change.
&gt; 
&gt; I want to head to team red, but I'm stuck with a lot of green tech.  
   

  

 
  
   
  
**I apologize for the long winded rant/explanation so here's a TL;DR to summarize it.
Fuck Nvidia, after buying into all the hype, and all the money wasted- I need your help in figuring out my change**

  
  
  
I've been trying to scour the internet in hopes of some benchmarks or how I should approach this because I plan on getting a 144hz Freesync Monitor and some hardware too.   
  
* *I want to xFire, does anyone have any possible suggestions on how well the Fury X scales? ( Mainly with MMO's like FFXIV )*
* *I would like to do aftermarket liquid cooling, should I go with an r9 Nano, or a Fury X? Or should I be waiting for the Fury x2?*  
* **[As far as panels go I was in particular going for this one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824009847)**   
* *Are there any concerns I should have with wattage or heat with using any of the aforementioned cards? I will be using this on a 1,000 Watt PSU with two systems hooked up to it ( in a Phanteks Mini XL )*  
  
* *Should I possibly be waiting for the new architecture? Polaris, or even the Fury X2?*  
  
* *Is there anything I haven't asked that I should know? I've done a lot of research, but most of the time community feedback is the best.*

But while most reviews use modern Intel CPUs to make their comparisons between DX11 and DX12, SA had some AMD CPUs on hand.

An FX-8370 more than doubled in performance when DX12 was turned on.

A Phenom II X4 955 more than *tripled* in performance when DX12 was turned on.

And, while AotS is dropping Mantle support, it will apparently be replaced by Vulkan support in the future.  Similar performance characteristics to DX12 can be expected once drivers mature."

* Ashes is an actual game not just a benchmark (which he knows from past posts).
* That the driver has crossfire profiles and performance increases in Tomb Raider along with a dozen of bug/issues that are fixed.

He posted multiple times in that thread ignoring anyone else trying to point out what the driver was actually for.

Not to mention that Nvidia has released multiple drivers for this game as well going back to august of 2015.

He just finished up his ""I love SLI Titan X"" puff piece even though they provide nothing over 980 TIs and he bought them after the 980 TI released. The only time he mentions AMD cards in the article is to talk about how hot his *reference* 290x CFX was.

Theres more if you want to look at any of his other posts regarding AMD but just thought it was worth sharing since its obvious that it effects their *subjective* reviewing style

Edit: Wow the rest of his responses in that thread to people are amazing...

&gt;Funny stuff there, let me ""Twitter"" AMD to see what they are actually saying in their press releases. Too bad a multi-million dollar company (in losses) can't get a PR writer that can write with clarity."

Amd,croshd,20,1,"R9 390 with dual monitorI have a new rig coming: i7-6700k, MSI R9 390, Gigabyte Z170 Gaming5, 16gb DDR4 among other things. I will be using two monitors, one 27"" 1440p and another 23"" 1080p. The smaller one is used only when programming more or less and some light browsing/usual.

I've read that the card gets ""hot"" on idle with the fans on default only kicking in at 60C using two monitors. I was wondering what the downside of me plugging the smaller one in the Intel HD would be ? Or if anyone knows of a better solution to keep the temp down in idle while using the auto fan setting (basically keeping the temp low enough in non-gaming scenario so that the fans are off).

I Recently got a 1600P display, only connectable by DL DVI-D.

I tried the cables with my old 7950 and it gave me 0 issues. Fine, i thought. I guess this GPU wont support this monitor. I should go back to my old setup. 2x27 1200p monitors.

Now it will only connect to one monitor at full 1920x1200, the other is stuck at 1024x768.

As rise of the tomb raider is very demanding, I chose to overclock it using Sapphire Trixx. My card is not a very good overclocker it seems as I can only get 1100/1500 (I didn't overclock the memory) at +31mv voltage increase/20% power increase. My temperatures during full load is around 65-71 with my custom profile. I would like to ask if these are normal temperatures? (Likewise, is attempting a further overclock with +100mhz safe?] Also, should I disable ULPS?

You only have the option to select profiles for trouble shooting other titles or using a profile to force CrossfireX on other games.

Hi! So I was looking at GPUs as I am interested in building a high end PC to play at 1440p 144hz and want a high end GPU for it. I don't like or have a need for Nvidia or its features, I prefer AMD. However, AMD doesn't cater for this much, the Fury X has only 4gb of VRAM, which isn't quite enough for those wanting to bump up their resolutions like I am. It's puzzling that they give 8gb of vram to a more mid range GPU above a high end GPU. 

So, to solve this, a new card would surely have to be released. Obviously, there is no way to confirm this, unless I missed an article, but some kind of new high end card with 8gb+ vram would be great. Would AMD release a card like this? Would you buy it? Would it be any good?

I don't like separate software for my GPU but if I could chose which recording software, for example, I could use but still be integrated in Crimson it would really tidy things up.

I don't think anybody should straight up be able to make extensions but maybe in cooperation with AMD.

Amd,Ruthuin,27,3,"Freesync and frame limitHi /r/Amd,

I've recently purchased an MG279Q 144hz Freesync monitor and am blown away by the difference.  Going from a 1080p 60hz monitor to this is night and day.  Though, I was wondering if I should be limiting my FPS to 144 while using Freesync as I've read that going over 144 with a 54-144hz Freesync range can cause tearing similar to dropping below the Freesync range or just playing without Freesync/Vsync.  What I gather from the bit of reading I've done is that any 3rd party frame limiting application will increase delay by a small amount. (As little as .25ms with RivaTuner)  

So, is it worth it to enable a frame limiting application at the cost of delay and will there be a noticeable difference between 144FPS @ 144hz and say 240FPS @ 144hz?

Edit:  I found some great information from a post by /u/163941.  Link:  https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/35dry0/question_regarding_gsyncfreesync/cr4j0ly

To summarize, the best way to limit fps is within the game settings, but if that isn't available, then either Vsync with flip queue size set to 1 and a frame rate cap or Rivatuner.  In game frame limit settings create a ~14ms input delay while Vsync with flip queue size and a frame rate cap creates ~21ms input delay.  Rivatuner is the best 3rd party application to create a global fps cap and creates ~25ms input delay."

Amd,darkserith,11,8,"Can't get ASUS MG279Q FreeSync Range Changed...Trying to use this guy's 57-144Hz Freesync Driver : 
http://nils.schimmelmann.us/post/133778060542/extending-the-asus-mg279q-freesync-range

My thoughts on maybe why this isn't working for me, and you can tell me what you think:

1) If I install the 57-144Hz driver, in AMD Crimson, it says that the FreeSync range is ""35-144Hz"" (this is weird since I thought the driver is only 57-144Hz??).

2) When I open up Monitor Asset Manager (""MonInfo""), which is one of the tools listed in the FreeSync EDID tutorial, it shows the old, original Driver information. It shows "" Vertical scan range...... 35-90Hz"" instead of ""Vertical Scan Range ...... 57- 144Hz"". Maybe this is why my FreeSync isn't working...Is this normal? After installing the hacked drivers correctly for 57-144 Hz, should the Monitor Asset Manager now list 57-144Hz as the Vertical scan range? Please open up Monitor Asset Manager and see what it lists for you.

3) In the ""Display IDs"" section of Monitor Asset Manager (top left corner window), it lists ""ACI27A7 [Registry]. I double click that, it goes to the ""Registry Editor"", with the old Registry info for the original driver listed. Maybe this Registry file is causing Monitor Asset Manager to think I want to use the old driver info with 35-90hz Vertical Scan range. Maybe I should delete this and it will store the Registry info for the 57-144Hz driver instead. Don't know.

Amd,sheepsheepsheepsheep,6,3,"R9 390 Causing Black Screens?In the last few weeks I've noticed that my screen would randomly go black and would not recognize any keyboard inputs. I started looking around online and it seems that there have been some people with the 290s that have had this problem and solved it by using older drivers. 

I went ahead and installed the 15.10 drivers again and it's gone about 40 hours with no crashes. Before it would crash after 2-3 hours of usage.

I can't seem to figure out what all I need to just run my games with minimal interference but still have the ability to make graphics tweaks as needed. So far I've seen these mentioned:

* Radeon Settings - Currently installed. Looks like I can adjust global graphics settings to games, video, etc. Is this all I really need?
* AMD Gaming Evolved (is this Raptr?) - Currently installed. I can appreciate what this does but I really don't want to use any of these features; I don't do screen captures and I prefer to optimize graphics myself. I think it's hogging up system resources as well. Can I uninstall it without issue? (It did update my drivers to the latest version, at least. Err.. it alerted me to outdated drivers and I had to manually download/install them.)
* CCC - Is this the AMD Catalyst? Do I need this? Not installed as far as I know.
* RadeonPro - Do I need this in addition with any of the above? I was reading that there are some features in this that isn't in some of the other software... namely dynamic v-sync. Not installed.

I am considering to upgrade from my Sapphire 7970 Ghz Vapor-X.

A obvious contender would of course be the R9 390, and while looking for one i found this [version of the 390x](https://www.alternate.de/XFX/AMD-Radeon\(TM\)-R9-390X-Black-Grafikkarte/html/product/1208803?event=search).  
What confuses me about it is that it goes for roughly the same price as a normal 390.  

So my question is:  
Is this just a good deal or is the card performing worse than other R9 390x cards?

ASUS has some pretty nice cashback deals going on here and they bring down the cost of a 380 STRIX (2GB) to 154€. That's the cheapest 380 around, the next begins at 180€.

Currently I only do 4 things on my PC: play/test starcitizen (alpha); work (programming); web browsing; and watch movies/tv shows.

On june 26th i've purchased a FuryX, 2 days after its launch. The experience on starcitizen @ 4k has been awesome on visual quality and not as great as i expected it to be on fps (18-45 depending on the game zone).

I do know that currently star citizen has server issues to be addressed causing the bad fps experience. No amd driver can fix that.

So since I found myself with an awesome and useless rig (for SC) i've sold my card for an awesome price (30eur less than its current price as new).

In my mind i'm planning to use the onboard graphics (asrock z97 extreme6 + 4790k) for the next 6 months and save the money for the greenland. At the same time i think its ridiculous to be programming surfing and watch movies on a 4790k with its intel hd graphics...

What should i do?

A) just sell everything trying to salvage the max i can and also wait for zen (that im aware that can end up in a flop knock knock knock)?

B) get a temporary and cheap card to still be able to follow SC?

C) stick to my plan and leave it as it is, keeping the high hopes on greenland?

Amd,Lonevvolf_,36,46,"The Switch from Nvidia to AMDThought I'd take the time to post a little something on here for the first time in hopes that someone browsing this subreddit for information on AMD graphics cards/ processors finds this anecdote useful. So, I finished my first PC build the other day. I've always gamed on PC, but the past few years have been on an overpriced ""gaming"" laptop running an Intel I7 and 2 Nvidia 2GB 750M's in SLI. It was definitely powerful, but both the laptop and my consoles left me always wanting more. I began doing research on computer parts and lo and behold I found the debate between AMD and Nvidia. If you're in this subreddit I assume you already know the details of the beef so I'll skip over that. Anyways, that left the decision between Nvidia and AMD for graphics, and AMD and Intel for processing. The majority of online resources would have you believe that Intel and Nvidia are a powerhouse combo that can't be matched, but if you spend the extra time looking at benchmarks and neutral reviews, the margin seems to be blurred. People will tell you that AMD is a bargain brand who is always trying to play catch-up, but that really isn't true. I decided to go with an AMD FX-8350 and a Powercolor PCS+ R9 390 for my cpu/gpu and I couldn't be happier. People will tell you that AMD gets way too hot and will cause crashes, that it's way too loud, and that you're better off shelling out extra money for ""better"" products. Nvidia may generally consume less power and generate less heat, but it isn't night and day. Also the software that both companies provide are about equal. Both programs let you download drivers as they are released, optimize games, etc. My CPU under load sits around 45c while my gpu sits around 60c in my Fractal Design Define R5. That isn't bad at all. My system isn't loud either. Even under load I could have the speakers off and not be bothered. In conclusion, I am completely satisfied with my AMD build. I picked up my gpu on Newegg for only $260 (after $20 rebate) in comparison to the gtx 970 which was $350. It crushes any modern title on ultra at or above 60fps that I've thrown at it. I hope AMD continues on the track that they've been on. Maybe I'll grab a Fury X in a few years :) 

EDIT:  This post is not saying that AMD beats Intel and Nvidia in every category. The point was that for a significant fraction of Intel processors and Nvidia graphics cards, AMD offers extremely competitive components. Is Intel going to put out chips with better single core performance? Yes. Is Nvidia going to release cards that draw less power and generate less heat? Yes. But is there such a real-world performance difference that the price gouging by say Nvidia is justified? No! For people like me who game regularly but aren't trying to have the overall undisputed best hardware regardless of price, AMD offers excellent products. I'm not worried about that extra couple hundred score on firestrike, or the couple extra frames on a game. When I'm gaming, the performance/visual differences are negligible. "

Amd,JoelWarl0ck,11,11,"Best R9 390 global setting?Hey all,

I recently upgraded from a GTX 550 Ti to a R9 390. Really good graphics card in my opinion but I think my rig can perform even better with this card. I got a lot of troubles with shadows when playing games. Significant performance loss happens when I play the latest games like GTA 5, Fallout 4, Vermintide etc.. Most of the times frame drops occur while looking out in the distance. (Looking out over cities and such). I don't know why this happens but when in close range my GPU performs just fine and reaches just above 60 FPS. Maybe I can tweak my performance more in the Catalyst Center but I would like some advice before doing so. I also wanted to mention that I run most of these games on High - Ultra/Extreme.

The main thing however, was that it was stable. After the update it's jumping everywhere between 60 and 10. It happens at seemingly random points as well, like running over some rocks or w/e. Raids are the same, moments when a lot is happening could be fine and then after a boss is downed and things quiet down the frame rate will still be jumping all over.  
I tried to lowering all settings from Ultra to high, reduced MSAA from 8x to 2x and that barely made any difference (higher frame rate, but still stuttering).

Here's what it looks like while I was playing fallout 4: https://gyazo.com/306fb072bc1e91405b76c516b61fb574

I have been playing LOL with no FPS drops, Witcher 3 no FPS drop, Benchmarking with Fumark with no FPS drops. Only games that had noticeable frame drops were Overwatch where I would have constant 60 FPS then drops to 15-20 and Fallout 4 when looking at large cities (I know fallout 4 optimization is bad.) Guildwars 2 FPS drops as well even thought it will run at a smooth 60 FPS then out of no where FPS drop.

After exiting my game I opened my sensor monitoring application to find my GPU was at 92 degrees, my fans were only spinning at 20%. The AMD Crimson had ignored my MSI Afterburner fan profile and had blocked my fans from running higher than 20%. I then foolishly setup a custom game profile for Dragon Age: Inquisition (the only game I have installed and am currently playing) and then uninstalled MSI Afterburner, then rebooted. After rebooting I found the custom fan profile to be stuck in global settings after every reboot. I wiped windows and installed only the one game and Crimson, same results... At this point I consider Crimson to be broken and if you value your GPU I cannot recommend using it. revert back to the previous drivers before your GPU overheats and fails like mine appears to have done.

Amd,RexOmnipotentus,19,13,"Core clock fluctuations with AMD FreeSync enabledI've had this problem for about 4 months now. In august i bought the LG 27UM67 4k FreeSync monitor. I love FreeSync, but it somehow messes with my core clocks. 


With FreeSync disabled everything works fine. The core clock of my two r9 290s stay at 1050mhz. However, if i enable FreeSync the core clock is all over the place. It might be only fluctuations that stay between 900 and 1050 mzh, but there are times it's becoming unbarable. 


Somehow FreeSync doesn't like CPU bottlenecks. As soon as i play SWTOR with FreeSync enabled (with one card, so not in CrossFire), the core clocks go as low as 500 - 600mhz in CPU intensive situations. This gives me a much much lower framerate than i would normally get without FreeSync. 


Anno 2205 is another example. At a certain spot i have CPU bottleneck (GPU usage isn't maxed out). Without FreeSync i get 40FPS. However, if i enable FreeSync i only get 18FPS. The core clock of both cards are hovering around between 300 and 500 mhz. 


I couldn't really find much about this problem on the internet, so i was wondering if there are more people that have this problem. If so, is there a way to fix this? This is a serious issue. "

Amd,harpuajim25,2,4,"Fan speed on Sapphire Fury was fluctuating between 25-60%. Fixed by uninstalling Crimson and going back to 15.11/15.11.1I am using Trixx to OC my card and I noticed that after gaming, the fan would fluctuate between 25-60% and even read 100% for a split second but I never heard the fan get to 100%.  I tired all different fan profiles (Custon, fixed, automatic) and the problem kept happening.  Uninstalling Crimson and installing 15.11 did it for me.  Not sure if it's the driver itself or the Crimson Overdrive software that's messing with the fan profile.  I didn't do 15.11.1 because I was getting the same issues in Battlefront that I was getting with Crimson but the fan issue was resolved.  Are they the same driver?  If so then that would most certainly point to the Crimson software as the issue.

In any case if your Sapphire (or any card for that matter) has this fan issue it can possibly be remedied by uninstalling Crimson and reinstalling the old drivers.

Had a little bit of a hard time finding 15.11 [so here's the link](http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/amd-catalyst-15-11-beta-driver-download.html)

Amd,abIngenui,6,7,"Sapphire Trixx and Crimson clock speed halvedSo I had Sapphire Trixx installed and then I installed Crimson. Uninstalled CCC with DDU. Everything great, right? Then in Fallout 4, I was having weird ass FPS fluctuations with my Fury X which is normally always 60FPS. The Tachometer was all over the place. Then I noticed that the temp was no more than 32C when it normally just chugs along at 62C. I checked the core clock and it would never go above 525MHz, even though my Trixx profile should tell it to go to 1130MHz. I uninstalled Trixx and now everything is back to normal, so something conflicts with each other. I hadn't even used the overdrive options for Crimson, so it isn't stuck on some stupid fan limit. I also then used the overdrive before reinstalling Crimson, and it didn't help anyways.

I also reinstalled Crimson and Trixx multiple times, and the moment I **apply** OC settings via Trixx, my Fury X never breaks 525MHz. 

So just a heads up in case anybody is having the same problem with performance issues. In the event that I am an idiot and am doing something wrong, feel free. 

EDIT: Uninstalled Trixx and reinstalled Crimson again. Now the card cycles from 1050MHz to 300MHz, with noticeable performance stuttering and dips. Back to CCC I go"

 If I upgrade next year to an Arctic Islands GPU can I keep the 290 in a second slot and have these 2 screens run off it, while running a third one off the main GPU - then putting them all in an Eyefinity group, or would there be latency problems running them across 2 different cards?

1- Which brand do you guys recommend me to buy? The MSI R9 390 or the Sapphire Nitro R9 390 tri-x oc? And why the one you have chosen over the other?


2- If both Gpus were overclocked would the r9 390 still beat the gtx 970?

edit: I got the complete wrong end of the stick. The shipping *and backplate* is $19. Overall. So that's £12 to get the backplate and ship it to the UK. A great deal in my opinion

Amd,whome2473,19,5,"What CPU and Motherboard do I need to run 2 290's in CrossfireX?I'm getting confused with all the sockets and compatibility issues of choosing a new motherboard and CPU for crossfiring 2 290s. I don't really wont to buy DDR4 RAM as my current ones are only a couple of years old. 

My current set up is a i5 2500k, 16GB(2x8GB) of AMD Gaming series RAM, a ASUS P8Z68-V LX (LGA1155), a Sapphire Vapor-X R9 290 (my brother upgraded so i can get his one for family rates), a Corsair RM1000 and a Asus MG279Q.

It can be either Intel or AMD but most AMD CPU's seem to perform a little shy of the i52500k. My current motherboard states it is crossfire ready but the second lane goes through the chipset for the hard-drives (or something along those lines). 

Any help will be much appreciated."
Amd,jorgp2,2,0,"With GDDR5X wouldn't board complexity go up, but you would still be limited to current chip counts.So maybe you could have a Hawaii type board with 16 memory ICs, and a 1024 bit bus. But you would need more layers to pack all the traces.

So its only benefit would be reducing the number of memory ICs needed to reach a certain bandwidth. Since it only doubles the memory interface per IC."

Edit - [Heaven Benchmarks](http://i.imgur.com/gAqX9TF.png)"
Amd,insanityisrequired,38,24,"I got a Carrizo machine (detailed info/bench)I've been wanting to get a Carrizo machine since April when I first heard about them. I have been holding out, hoping for a Carrizo chip tuned for power (35w) rather than efficiency (15w), but unfortunately all the OEMs are opting for efficiency. I've been keeping an eye on AMD's list of Carrizo laptops, particularly the A10 and FX models. I've been prepared to spend around $700 for a decent machine, but just recently I saw one listed on AMD's site for $350. It turns out the price was wrong - Staple's website said ""$400 with included $50 rebate"" so the actual starting price is $450. AMD's website apparently calculated wrong, taking the $50 rebate from the $400 after-rebate price instead of from the $450 starting price. That's OK though - I noticed and understood beforehand so I'm not upset with that. If anyone at AMD is reading this though, it might be a good idea to fix that problem on the website. Ultimately it isn't as powerful as I had wanted, but I decidced it was affordable enough to compromise and get it anyway because I do *not* want an Intel machine and I'm really tired of waiting. 

The machine:

* Toshiba L55D-C5269 from Staples (exclusive)

* AMD A10-8700P APU, 15w

* 15.6"" TFT 1366x768 (LG D0456, looks glossy, mfg: week 1 of 2014)

* 8gb DDR3L 1600mhz (2x4gb, single channel mode)

* 1TB 5400rpm HDD

* Windows 10

* Cost after rebate: $427~

I got a PNY XLR8 CS2111 480gb to replace the spinner that came with the machine. ($154~ from Amazon.) Unfortunately the bottom shell of the laptop is a solid piece. I haven't put it in yet, but I'm going to do it soon. Will probably void my warranty for opening up the machine, but I can live with that. Toshiba doesn't seem to have sent *too much* crapware with Windows, but I want a clean install anyway. I'll get around to the clean install of Windows soon. The machine has 2 identical 4gb sticks of 1600mhz DDR3 ram, but they're in single-channel mode and I can't figure out why or if it is possible to change it. The UEFI seemed ultra-minimalist compared to the BIOS in my desktop machine, it didn't have many settings at all. I did notice that Secure Boot can be disabled, but I haven't tried to boot a Linux distro on it yet.

**[Passmark benchmarks compared to my aging desktop machine](http://imgur.com/KzghutL)**

(Yes, I know Passmark is an Intel partner and almost certainly biased)


* Verdict

I was wanting a 17 inch 1920x1080 display, FX at 35w, 2x4gb 2133mhz dual-channel, and either an SSD or to put one in myself. This machine isn't as powerful as I originally wanted, but overall I think everything will be alright. The machine feels pretty zippy and responsive and the processor is actually a bit ahead of my desktop processor in general, which is pretty impressive given that my desktop processor is 125w. The graphics could be improved with faster ram and dual-channel mode, but ultimately for merely 15 watts it feels pretty impressive so far. I haven't tried any serious gaming yet, and it might be a while before I can really push this machine. I'm temporarily stuck with mobile internet so I can't go download my Steam library due to data limits and overage charges. The laptop is very attractive and elegant, I like the appearance very much. It has an optical drive and HDMI output, but no D-Subminiature port (Who still uses those anyway?). Overall I think I made the right choice in buying the machine rather than keep waiting. I'm open to requests to run more benchmarks or find more information with the machine if anyone is so inclined to ask. 

**EDIT**

I've now installed the SSD. It wasn't too difficult to take the laptop apart. Just a handful of standard phillips screws on the underside, pop out the optical drive and battery, then gently pry off the bottom shell. Toshiba says the RAM is ""not user replaceable"" in this model, but they didn't appear to be soldered in or anything. I didn't try taking one out though. I reinstalled Windows from a USB drive/restore that I created earlier. Reinstalling Windows took quite a while, but now we're back in business.

Alright, to start this off, I was aiming for a new build as an upgrade from my old rig (550ti and Phenom II x4 965). It was very overdue. 


----

**General Setup.**

I installed a fresh copy of windows 7 on my SSD. I was installing my GPU Drivers, Chrome and stuff Via Ninite on my USB when my Power went out. I have a surge protector and everything had seemed alright. It booted and chrome was buggy as heck due to the half install, Gpu driver thought it finished installing. I reinstalled the driver for safety.

Pretty long, but it wasn't the longest setup. I was sure as hell excited though.

 
 ^^I ^^ended ^^up ^^with ^^driver ^^issues ^^I ^^mention ^^bellow ^^but ^^I ^^eventually ^^upgraded ^^to ^^windows ^^8 ^^and ^^had ^^graphical ^^errors ^^and ^^blackscreens ^^on ^^login. ^^I ^^ended ^^up ^^reformating ^^and ^^installing ^^everything ^^correctly.

----

**Experience when I first got it running.**


Now It really blew me away for the most part. Alien Isolation was the first  Graphically intensive game I played at 60+fps ever. 

Some games did rather poorly, Like Minecraft (barely 45 fps in vanilla) and ArmA 2/3 was expected to do bad since it relies on your CPU mostly and the single core clock speed is not the greatest. I was getting around 20-40 fps in multiplayer.

I really did enjoy the visuals but for performance, it really was never very stable with me. I don't know if it was the CPU or just my GPUs. I dealt with quite a few issues, like having crossfire on and plugging in a new monitor would bluescreen half of the time, Updating the driver with both cards plugged in crossfire or not it would bluescreen and generally ruin my driver install. I got around that by installing driver updates then adding the second card in, although it was a pretty shitty diy solution, it worked. 

Tbh I'm not sure if I was unlucky, I actually got a third 280x to test if one of mine was damaged, it bluescreened no matter the setup. Switching the boards had 0 effect. I ended up keeping the jerryriged solution permetly.


Now back to performance, With most games I could pull around 150 to 200 fps, Some games like GTAV had issues, While I could get 160 fps while standing still with crossfire, moving or driving around it'd drop to 40 fps. Using just 1 of the cards (either one) It'd generally sit around 70-80 and drop only as low as 60.

Not the worst, but I did max out pretty much option at 1080p. 

---


**Overclocking.**

I really wanted to push my fx-9590.

When I first got it I was running at 4.70Ghz factory clock with turbo to 5Ghz. I managed to get a stable-ish clock at 5.25Ghz but Ended up dropping to 5Ghz for heat reasons, I have a H100i Liquid cooler, and it had issues running that clock on my 990FXA-UD3 mobo, but switching mobos had solved that.

-----------

**Future**

I rarely run into games I can't play at a good FPS with max settings, If I could chosen different parts at the time I think I wouldn't really have changed much, I wish I waited a couple months since I paid $300 cad per card and they dropped $100 a few months after.

I've used a Oculus rift DK2 with my setup and it runs at a high framerate, but as you'd expect for a devkit there were quite a few issues. Like mainly suttering when moving your head which was really disorientating. It was in the bug tracker for months and pretty much burried with little recognition.

For CSGO which is pretty much [the only thing I play now](http://i.imgur.com/uA1Pw3n.png). It's a bit different than other games. 
When I first got the build I was running Dust2 at around 400-600 fps at all times with pretty bad screen tearing. Couldn't really fix that with vsync since it causes horrendous mouse lag.
I wish my performance stayed that high, but as time has passed I seem to run at 200-300 fps and some maps running around 80-120. I get frequent drops to 40 fps all the time along with the rest of the community as I've read so I just assume that to be a bad CSGO update.

For a future build upgrade, I think I'll grab a Fury-X.
I don't think I will ever stop being an AMD guy.

Sorry if this doesn't quite fit, Mods feel free to remove this if it doesn't, I just want to do a bit of everything right now and really wanted to type something up and kill a little time. I'd love to hear the subreddit's opinions and experience with AMD thus far, whether it be storys that made you switch sides, or how your AMD build has treated you.


----



**TLDR:** I've used AMD for over a year now, It has had a Hell of a lot of good times and a semi-hefty amount rough times, Lot's of driver issues and crossfire performance troubles. Overall, I've dealt with quite a lot of problems but I've got tons of use and performance out of my AMD hardware. I've even managed to get my CPU to 5.25Ghz decently stable and I've not yet run into many games I cannot max out with a good fps. I think I'll be upgrading to a R9 Fury-x next if nothing better comes along by January. I don't think I'll be leaving team red any time soon.

I tried to find better specs, but I couldn't.  If I had to guess I would say Sata 2, but I am not sure.

930 CPU

7950 Boost GPU

I think PCI-E SSD would be questionable, which would likely limit me to SATA.  It's backwards compatible, so I don't see any reason to go with an older version, which means SATA3 is the obvious choice.

Next year I plan on building a new system, and will hopefully transfer this thing over, so I want to make sure it's sort of future proof, though I think anything above 3GB/s isn't needed for gaming anyways.

I will primarily use it for OS and gaming, maybe some autodesk work, and my budget is about $100

http://au.pcpartpicker.com/p/pTJZMp

However, for the last year or so, or since Nvidia released the 900 series, they've been dropping the ball. So much so that when I built this rig two months ago, I was scurrying about, trying to get the most stable version of the drivers to install on my new computer. The 660 was reused from my old computer (so was the PSU admittedly, had to buy it early since my old PSU had Cockroaches get into it).

A month ago, I was playing Spellforce 2: Shadow Wars on my computer and the game locked up for some reason, sound bugs and all that. I had to Alt-Ctrl-Del to get access to the Task Manager, except the game was taking priority over everything else and non-responding so I couldn't use the Task Manager to close it. Had to restart my computer, turns out my GPU driver had crashed and had 'recovered', on top of a LiveKernelEvent error (I didn't get a Blue Screen, thank god that would have been worrying). Didn't happen again.

I play Borderlands 2 today, this issue rears its head, and I had to shut my computer down and then start it back up to make it recover. Turns out same deal with the drivers and LiveKernelEvent.

As I am unable to update to the latest drivers due to general NVIDIA incompetence for the last 6+, and apparently having issues even with these supposedly 'stable' drivers (even though these issues are rare at best), I have considered the possibility of getting a AMD card instead of a NVIDIA card to replace my Asus GTX 660 Direct CU II OC Edition.

Is the 390X worth getting at the moment within the next few months, or is it worth waiting for AMD to release their HBM lineup? AMD's drivers seem stable enough from what I hear (I never really bought into that whole 'terrible' drivers thing, I remember rocking an awesome Sapphire card back in the day when I had a rig with a Pentium 4 in it), so I'm willing to take the plunge at least.

Hopefully HBM drives down power requirements (why must all the new generation cards use more power than my 660. DX Australia plllls)"

Should I get R9 280(X) over GTX 960? Model of R9 280X: Asus DirectCU II Top 3GD5. Model of GTX 960: Gigabyte G1 2GD5 GTX 960.

MOSTLY, going to play CS:GO. I would like to maintain 250+ FPS on LOW/MEDIUM details at 1024x768 or 1280x1024 resolutions. I would like to play newer games, like GTA V, Hitman 2015, Mirrors Edge 2, stuff like that. Doesn't need to be ultra details (would be awesome if I could run at those details). I can get this 280X for lower money then 960 but then I need much more expensive PSU to buy, so I need to wait few months more to save some money. Is it worth it? Will GTX 960 serve me well in those games, or is it worth to save some money for 280X? My CPU is i5-4440, I can switch to H81 from Z87 board before I buy, but I was considering EVGA 650W 80+ Gold PSU for 280X, but It's hella expensive, maybe I can get Seasonic 620W 80+ Bronze for 35 euro lower price and then I need few euros more, but is that all worth to get H81 board, 500 gb HDD, Bronze PSU, lower-tier case for 280X over GTX 960?

Amd,solarvoltaic,30,5,"When to upgrade? Omega3 + Arctic Islands + ZenI plan on building a complete PC next year, perhaps early 2017, and here are my thoughts on the matter.

I was giving some thought to my upgrade path as of late, after hearing AMD is releasing their new driver pack Omega2, this November.  

Originally, I was thinking about upgrading into Arctic Island GPU immediately, but now I believe it would be prudent to wait at least until the Omega3 drivers are released.  This is of course assuming that the arctic islands will release before next year of course!  

Why?  Well, there are two good reasons for this,

- 1)  Drivers on release will likely suck.  Omega has been shown to have HUGE performance boosts for their hardware.

- 2)  Price.  The cost of these cards always start astronomically high, particularly if there is no competition on the market, and then drop drastically to their real value after a few months.

Which card am I going to get.  Apparently, AMD is planning on only using HBM2 on their enthusiast, and high end gaming cards.  The rest will be using DDR5x.  I expect the combination of the HBM2 with new architecture, which according to AMD has ""twice the performance per watt"", should yield a sizable difference in performance with DDR5x.  Thus, my original plan was to simply purchase the cheapest AMD card that offered HBM2.  

However, If I wait, I will be able to see the benchmarks with Omega 3 drivers to ensure I get the best long term Performance/$ GPU.  I could potentially even go team Nvidia as well, which seems questionable, but not impossible.  It depends on the node size, as well as the performance and cost of HBM2.  

Now, the next most important component, the CPU.  I think we can all admit that Intel has basically been taking massive dumps on AMD for quite a few years now, but Zen might actually change that.  That's why I had originally planned on waiting for some benchmarks, and purchasing Zen early.  But now, I have decided to wait post release again for two reasons.

- 1)  New CPU architecture seem to always come with a host of new issues, particularly with the motherboards.  There are often bugs that require a bios flash update, which is often a hassle.  Personally, I would rather avoid the aggravation, and wait a couple months.

- 2)  This is the same as before, the initial retail price is very often drastically inflated, and comes down quickly post release.

- 3) Cannonlake is expected in Q1 2017.  This is a 10nm process from Intel.  I want to support AMD, but if Intel's new CPU comes out, and once again shits on AMD, then I might have to go team blue again.

I think I'm not alone having problems finding decent laptops with AMD APUs and/or dGPUs. These laptops are rarely available, hard to find, and rarely have the latest and greatest parts from AMD. Also AMD laptops are often cheap and of poor quality. Having a list of laptops worth buying that you can actually buy in my opinion would be worthwhile and it would help promoting AMD products.

I think we should have a list of ""recommended"" laptops on the wiki ""Products"" section. Maybe a table containing data like:

* Date released
* Countries/Region where it's available (USA/UK/Germany/Russia etc.)
* Manufacturer
* Technical details- CPU/GPU/screen size/resolution/RAM/disk/etc.
* Link to buy it?

I think we should concentrate on higher-end laptops, with A8-A12 APUs, or ones with AMD dGPUs, and screens above 1024x768 resolutions. Or maybe ultrabooks as well.

What do you think?

For users downvoting my question for no apparent reason: this is not a ""the problem is in your head"" button, and you're not helping at all.  
The issue is real, and people should be well aware of it, not the other way around. So if you don't have anything constructive to say, then please just move on. Thanks.

*UPDATE:* when playing the game, I hear a weird noise from the case, I think it might be coil whine.  
Done the DDU uninstall and reinstall of the drivers, no success. On DX11, I also get weird 2d glithces, like the letters and numbers on the mission end screen flashing white periodically (maybe 2 Hz).

**UPDATE 2:** reinstalled the whole system with only the most necessary things (15.8 beta) and the problem is still there the same just like before, so if it is a software problem, it is most probably not on my end.  
I'm getting very frustrated now. I'll try some other suggested solutions I didn't have time for until now; if none works out, I'll have to find a replacement model (price/performance-wise it looks pretty much non-existent).

*UPDATE 3:* updated my BIOS to the most recent one, and while it prolonged the time without crashing quite significantly (30-40 mins until the dreaded black screen), it didn't help at all.  
I am already getting tired of this bullshit, all I wanted is to play GTA on nice settings. What I got in reality is 3 sleepless days looking for answers so far and not even an hour of relaxed gameplay, not to mention 6+ as usual.  
I really don't want all this crap after ditching 380€ on a single graphics card. My old 7970 never had a single problem in 3 years, I was expecting the same from this one. Now I'm starting to miss the old card a lot...

-----

Hello all!  

I know this is not a tech support subreddit, but my problem is probably beyond that, as I think I've tried everything I found reasonable to try to solve my problem. I hope that someone in the community might have already found the solution by now of which I'm unaware of.

R9 3XX series graphics card owners may already know about this by now. It seems no matter what brand the 390 card is, it is vulnerable to this failure, as I've seen all kinds of cards having the same problem in various support forums including Sapphire, ASUS, XFX, MSI, Powercolor, HIS...  
I just upgraded my faithful Sapphire 7970 Dual-X (very good card, loved it) to a Sapphire R9 390 Tri-X Nitro, and after the initial delight from the big jump in performance compared to the old card, I had to realize that I won't be able to enjoy the main reason for which I upgraded - namely GTA V.

My exact problem is getting a black screen and a system lock-up after playing for some time (5-20 mins) in online mode. No reaction to Ctrl-Alt-Del for like 30 seconds, and after a very sluggish wait, the error message ""GTA V has stopped working"" appears, letting me close it (very slowly). My temperatures are always way below threshold (both GPU and CPU in the 60's), so that can be ruled out I guess.

Things that I've tried so far:  
-Reinstalling the display drivers: no success  
-Reinstalling the whole AMD package: still no success  
-Removing the drivers via DDU and reinstalling them after: at first it seemed to be OK (5-&gt;10 minutes play time), but the problem returned shortly  
-Removing MSI afterburner: I've read this solved a guy's problem, even though he wasn't running the software when the errors occurred - no improvement  
-Installing 15.8 beta drivers: it improved the time before the crash from 10 to like 15 minutes, but hasn't solved it  
-Running the game in DX10.1 mode: this has brought the best improvement yet (15-&gt;20-30 minutes), as I've been able to complete a flight school lesson and a capture match before crashing out

I really can't wrap my head around this phenomena, as it certainly is something I've never met before. The card is out for almost 3 months now, so I'm sure there must be a solution out there, but hours and hours of googling to no avail got me tired very fast. I just want to enjoy my games with my shiny new card without any hassle I didn't even know of before.  

Information about my running conditions:

System specs:

Hardware  
-ASUS Maximus VII Ranger mobo  
-Intel Core i7 4790k CPU @ 4.4 GHz (stock turbo)  
-Sapphire R9 390 Tri-X Nitro OC (11244-00-20G) (BIOS version: 015.048.000.062, date: 2015/05/27) @ stock speeds with UEFI button ON  
-16 GB Corsair Vengeance DDR3 @ 2133 MHz  
-Corsair CX600M PSU  
-3xDell U2312HM all connected via DisplayPort cables  

Software  
-Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1  
-Catalyst 15.8 beta (driver package version 15.201.1151-150821a-188451E)  
-GTA V (Online version: 1.28) running on a single monitor in 1080p with settings yielding an average of 60-70 fps  

I've tried every solution I found working for others to no avail, so if anyone has any ideas, or sees an error in my ways, I'd be glad to receive their input on the topic.  
I hope there's an easy fix - for an older GPU architecture and a brand new card, this shouldn't even be a thing.

Thanks in advance!"

But I noticed my fan keeps powering up and down every minute or so.

What do you guys think as to which is less stressful for the card and fan? 
 a)Higher temps and fan powering  up and down often, but fan mostly turned off; or
 b)Lower temps but fan turned-on all the time."

Amd,RRekaer,35,11,"Been thinking about buying an AMD GPUFirst of all Congrats on getting your old AMD Reddit back! I've been stalking the other amd reddit to know what's been happening lately

To tell you the truth, i was a super nvidia fanboy when i first got my gtx 650ti

then month by month i have been dissapointed with there game drivers and some controversial things they did  (directx12 async etc)

[This is what i mean ayy lmao](https://www.reddit.com/r/AyyMD/comments/3jk410/life_as_an_nvidia_fanboy_zoom_in_required/)
so next summer my gtx 650ti is going to say bye bye so i have to buy a new graphic card that is compatible with my motherboard

and play games in 1080p ultra or at least very high and cost less than 200$ or i can increase my budget a little more by 250$

I Have been thinking of buying GTX 750TI Because they say it's an console killer and can run games (like GTA V) In 1080p Very high

Then i saw there is an compatible AMD Card for my motherboard

This kinda brought back memory's because my very first pc is using an AMD Card (using that i played GTA SA Max payne 1&amp;2 etc)

So i kinda want to buy an AMD Card for good times sake but me having little to no knowledge of AMD Cards i'm clueless on what to buy

So what is the best amd graphic card for less than 200$ or maybe even less than 250$ that can run 1080p very high or ultra or at least maintain an constant 60fps on heavy games

These are my Current spec

GPU
Palits GTX 650TI 1gb

CPU
I3 3240 3.4Ghz 

RAM
4gb of Ram


Motherboard
AsusteK H61M-E

(Don't know the name but)
500PSU

and the Traditional Cooling (Fan)
If i missed any information please tell it :&gt;

anyways from what i heard AMD GPU Heat up fast if not cooled enough is that true? or it only affect certain type of GPU?

If i do switch is there an Program similar to geforce experience that notifies you with new Drivers and has an Game recorder like shadowplay?

Amd,IPman501,81,65,"AMD A10 APU gaming machine. It really works!I already posted this in r/PCMasterRace, but it got buried pretty quickly and I wanted to show this off to the AMD crowd! 

My wife, sister-in-law and myself have been having a blast playing Smite. It is our first MOBA but we enjoy it because we can all play together. However, my sister-in-law, lets call her Beth, was using a $250 Asus Wal-Mart special...which I'm surprised she was even able to load Smite, let alone play it. It was locking up on her frequently and it (obviously) played/looked like garbage. She decided she wanted something better, so I offered to build a PC for her that would run Smite without her current limitations. She was skeptical I could do it affordable, but I told her to just trust me and I would take care of everything. I looked into buying prebuilt (I know, the blasphemy of it), but everything was WWAAAAAY too expensive going that route for getting anything decent. I tried ebay, but custom computer building is abysmal if you are looking to get your money back, so that was too expensive as well. I then created a list on PC Part Picker (located here: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/QY473C) and she bought the APU, motherboard and RAM. I bought the case and the PSU. Beth already had the Monitor and I bought Windows 10 on the software swap for $25.
Before the cries of ""you could have gotten so much better for just a little more money!"" start, Beth wanted to go as cheap as possible while still being somewhat of a quality build. With the APU, I saved by not have to buy a graphics card, and she can always get an R7 250 later to do dual graphics if she wants more horsepower for games. I have also posted the pictures of this build. This was a SUPER fun build and I'm glad Beth is happy with her rig. I just wanted to share with my brothers! Let me know what you think! https://imgur.com/a/ZjcmM

TL;DR Sister-in-law wanted to play MOBAs. Built an APU based PC for her. She loves it. Even plays Skyrim at around 35 FPS

EDIT: My reply to those who say I should have gotten a cheaper case: my biggest regret for my first build was getting a budget case. That piece of junk was not even square, and it was horrible and ugly. Hardly any ventilation options, cramped space inside. The steel had very sharp edges that could cut easily as well. I made up my mind right then that I would never buy a cheap case again. Since I was the one buying it for this build, I didn't mind spending a little extra to get something nicer. Beth wanted something pretty, not ugly crap. But, if Beth would have bought it, I probably would have recommended something cheaper. 

My reply to all those that said I should have stuck with the stock cooler: The stock cooler is total crap. It's loud, and ineffective. I did ALOT of research and being that this is an APU, it gets hotter than a normal CPU and requires better cooling. I knew that Beth would be doing gaming that this APU wasn't necessarily designed for, so I wanted to be sure she didn't have any issues with temps getting too high. Again, it may seem like overkill, but I didn't want high temps to stop her from being able to play the games that she wanted to play. 

Thanks for all the comments and the suggestions!"

It sat on top of the GPU chip and took up no more surface area than the chip itself. It was raised about an inch and a half high off the entire board. The rest of the board was covered in even tinier heatsinks. It had a dark green PCB; don't ask me why. I was just lying in my bed with the card in my hand. I sat there looking at it as long as I could just thinking that if I focused on it long enough, it might still be there when I woke up. After realizing it was a dream... I wished I hadn't. The dream ended promptly after and my headboard was bare of any silicon. Maybe if I tried harder... it might have been mine."

Since I installed the drivers, Every so often (About twice a day) My display drivers will crash and instantly recover, Giving me a message saying such.

At first I put this down to beta drivers will be beta drivers but then I started getting some weird artifacting when using HTML5 players, Such as flickering video and a corrupted taskbar that instantly corrects itself on hover.

I wanted to rule out the possibility of a failing Graphics card because the only ones I have to replace my 270X are a 5850 and a 9600GT.

I have had graphic cards fail in the past and they have been a bit more spectacular in doing so but you never know, This could just be the beginning.

Later tonight, I'll probably downgrade the drivers to test this out seeing as I have completed GTA V on 360 a year prior anyway.

Using Prime95, I managed to max out my cpu with a temperature of 28.2c, this is making me think I may have received an over-performing cpu once again and I would love to overclock the processor. However I am using a h100i (running the stock fans at 900rpm for silence) and am not sure as to whether or not these temps are common with this cooler or if I am right in thinking this is an over-performer.

Amd,zyphelion,15,3,"Gigabyte R9 290 frustrationsBack in January I bought this card and it has been... bothersome, to say the least. First off, my mouse pointer turned really big. I'm talking the size of a nickel. I sit on a 40"" TV screen but it is still way out of proportion. What's even more weird is that whenever I try to screenshot it, the image won't even display a mouse pointer at all. At first I thought it was one of the settings in the mouse options or the help centre that was acting up, but it is still set to the default setting.

Anyway, now on to my real grief. The card started to run hot when I was doing simple desktop stuff like browsing, working or watching movies. I'd get [these artifacts (old screenshot)](http://i.imgur.com/wmogalr.jpg) on certain web pages but nowhere else. The temperature was hovering between 92-95°C and the fan worked at 40-44%. Did some googling and found out that the card was built to sustain these kind of temperatures. That's odd, I thought. I assumed I wouldn't get these artifacts if this was the case. But no biggie, they weren't overly annoying.

But then it started going downhill. When I tabbed out of games (old and new) it took ages to reach the desktop. The screen would turn black for about 8 seconds and the music and sound would stop during that time, even if it was set to play even when tabbed down. Even when I use the windows button+L to lock my computer, it locks up with everything visible for about 4 seconds then the screen turns black for another 3 seconds, before showing me the lock screen.

So I reinstalled the drivers (14.1) and it was all fine. Temperature was down to 40°C and fan speed was at 25%. But over the weeks it has slowly been creeping up again. [This is a picture on how it has looked like the past 6 hours](http://i.imgur.com/CG9KsbB.png). Should the load really be at 100% all the time? I'm not great when it comes to how GPU's work, but that sounds strange to me.

Letting the machine rest for a few hours doesn't really help much. It takes less than an hour for temperatures to get back up to these levels.

By the way. The computer was freshly formatted when I first installed the card.

Please help me. What is going on?

Edit: Oh yeah, as for the first screenshot. I tried to use the new card to mine crypto currencies. But I haven't dared continuing with that since I started looking into my GPU's temperatures."

All parts are new and everything appears to be working well, except when I installed windows and it's doing its restart thing during the installation process, the process stalls and the graphics card appears to still be on, fans blowing (other fans are blowing too). I didn't think anything of it, kept on with the driver installation and such, but every time i needed to restart the same thing happened.  I tried resetting the cmos, disabling certain things in the power and usb settings. I swapped out drives and did fresh windows installs on them too and same thing happened. Did mem test and everything looks good there. I swapped out the graphics card with my old nvidia gtx460 (pny) and the restart issue disappeared. Plugged the new card back in and the issue comes back, so I think its the graphics card. I can shut down with no problem, and there appear to be no heating issues.

Well it extracted the driver like normal but when the install manager went to open it says that Catalyst Mobility can't be downloaded because the version of my graphics adapter is not supported. I found this really strange since the auto detect recommended the same thing. For shits and giggles i downloaded the desktop counterpart to see if the install manager would open. Sure enough it opened but under the custom installation option the list is only populated with the install manager and HDMI drivers (i know this is common and searching 'should' give me an answer but i have searched alot and nothing has helped). Well I didn't know exactly what to do since I now had no drivers and windows didn't recognize my GPU. I hopped onto the Samsung site (my laptop manufacturer) to grab the Samsung drivers.

I mainly upgraded to play BF4, however i seem to be getting terrible performance in this game where i see others on lower hardware or the same hardware as me that are running this game without problems at Ultra 1080p without dips. There's only a few maps where my GPU usage is 90-96% (silk road, operation locker, golmund railway) Most other maps are barely pushing 55-80 gpu usage, which is complete ass and probably has something to do with the drops i'm seeing in game.

I have tried so many things since day one to get my machine running like it should, things I've done: Upgraded to latest 14.11 beta drivers, reinstalled windows multiple times, reinstalled BF4 multiple times, tweaked the cfg settings, turned the powersaving featuers off my bios (unless i missed something), made sure my temps weren't causing my hardware to throttle.

My temps for my cpu never go above 55C with the stock cooler which isn't bad under load, Idling around 38C. Gpu gets maxed out at 60C, Idles at about 45C.

I'm all out of ideas and am a little frustrated that I'm getting such garbage performance with the hardware BF4 has recommended. Please could someone help me figure out what is wrong with my setup so that i can play BF4 on Ultra 1080p @60Hz without any drops!

Thanks in advance :)

Today something terrible happened, an amazing processor died this morning.

I had ordered a h100i for my AMD Phenom II X6 1100T, I already knew from the three years I had it, that it was an over-performing cpu. So I could not wait to overclock it with a closed-loop water-cooler.

I prepared everything for the battle that would take place, screwdrivers, anti-static wristband, the lot. I could not have my cpu be damaged, it would be too costly of a loss.

I unscrewed the old cpu cooler, and that's when it happened. As I gently pulled the cpu cooler from the motherboard, the cpu came with it. Attached and with the motherboard lever still locked. 

I couldn't bare to look at the pins, but knew I had to.

I twisted the cpu cooler from the valiant hero only to realise that the thermal paste had created a very strong bond, I flipped over the cpu and found an array of bent pins, I was devastated.

For an hour and a half I was desperately trying to fix the pins using a sewing needle, I was getting close, but then a pin broke from the cpu and I just stared in disbelief as it slowly slid down the cpu.

I loved that cpu and really didn't want to let it go, sadly, I must now replace it. I was tempted to go with Intel but instead decided to stay within the AMD family. I've ordered a new FX 6300, but my 1100t will not be forgotten."

They all use XP Pro, which of course, is being phased out in April by MS.  Our ""tech guy"" who really isn't that good, wants to replace all of the store computers first.  That's fine, except our hardware is starting to show age.  The HDDs are starting to slow down, and on the p4 board a capacitor has blown.

So that leaves APUs which would work good, but since it's coming out of our pockets, that would be quite expensive.  And I refuse to put i3s or i5s as they would be really really expensive.  $149.99 for the starting price on a CPU?  No thanks.

Also, is there a website or store that sells older stuff like Phenom IIs and earlier?  I was planning on ordering from geeks.com but they quit.  That leaves ebay, which I don't want to do, or Amazon.  But I'd like to get stuff for even cheaper."

As for the GPU will the ""new"" R7 250x work in dual with Kaveri?  Is there any benefit with getting a 2GB DDR3 card vs 1GB DDR5.  Does anyone think they'll support higher cards like the 260's in the near future?

2. I tried disconnecting my primary monitor, when I did the flicker went over to my secondary monitor until I plugged the primary one back in.

3. I took a screenshot and on it I could see how my monitor looked below the flicker and it was perfectly normal.

4. While flickering my GPU Usage on the MSI Afterburner graph went up to 50%.


Does anyone have any idea what could have caused this?

Amd,Teabagfiasco,4,3,"R9 290 ThrottlingHi r/AMD! I understand that this may not be the best place to ask for help but I am running out of options. I recently purchased an XFX R9 290 Black Edition graphics card and CANNOT get this card to hit 100% GPU load when gaming. 

After hours of testing the past two weeks I notice that my GPU usage is normal for the first 5 mins or so of gaming after the computer has been off for a long duration. I'm curious if anyone has noticed this type of behavior on an AMD GPU before. I initially believed it was throttling due to high temps, but blasting the fan at 80% speed keeps it cool and yet the behavior continues. I've followed all suggestions from varying forums to no avail (tried all recent CCC drivers with DDU, reinstalled Window 8.1, different fan profiles, etc).

It appears me card is throttling itself at a very low temperature. The only thing I'm wondering is if there is a way to edit the BIOS to control the throttling point. I'm not familiar with manipulating BIOS on these cards and I'm frankly unsure if it's even possible. Any help would be appreciated!"

CPU specs:

Win 8.1, 64 bit, i5-4670k, 8 gig ram, Sapphire R9 290 (Elpdia)

Here was my fix: (Make sure all downloads are for 64 bit)

* First remove all display drivers and Catalyst (except for on board drivers) | [Display driver uninstaller](http://www.guru3d.com/files_details/display_driver_uninstaller_download.html)
* Download Trixx OC utility  , install | [TRIXX](http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/?cid=1&amp;gid=3&amp;sgid=1227&amp;lid=1&amp;pid=2070&amp;leg=0)
* Download old install drivers/Catalyst 13.9 |  [ Catalyst 13.9](http://www2.ati.com/drivers/13-9_win7_win8_64_dd_ccc_whql.exe) - this will not include 290 drivers so bear with it.
* Download and install Catalyst 13.11 beta 9.5 &amp; reset computer| [Catalyst 13.11 beta 9.](http://www2.ati.com/drivers/beta/amd_catalyst_13.11_betav9.5.exe) - this should make your video card work now, do all your minor desktop fixes now like over-scan and whatnot.
* Open Trixx and increase your VDDC offset to +25mv

This should make your card stable enough to use or for me it did.

Amd,3doggg,12,7,"I've just learnt about AMD VCE (video codec engine). Any video recording software that makes good use of it?Since I'm CPU bottlenecked I've been looking for a way to have my GPU (7950) do the encoding while recording gameplay, thus freeing my CPU of x.264 encoding.

I've learnt about AMD VCE, and theoretically it seems to be somewhat similar to what Nvidia uses on its shadowplay.

However I've failed to find any codec that I can install to use on video recording software such as Dxtory.

Are there any codecs or video recording software that make use of AMD VCE, if not, why? Is it just a marketing gimmick?

In short: I'm looking for a way to record gameplay, encoding it on the go like I do with x.264 but using the GPU rather than the CPU."

Amd,saidos,16,4,"XFX HD 7770 Core - Black screen / NoiseWhile using an XFX HD7770 core 1ghz edition I've been experiencing black screens randomly after playing games or doing other graphically intensive activity on the PC.

I'm defaulting to believing it's the video card, as the black screens will simply stop sending image to the monitor (I will get a no input message) but all sound and such will continue, and the PC will not shut off, and CPU fan and HDD will still function audibly.

No errors found in event viewer for this latest shutdown, but I do recall seeing video driver stopped working on prior occasions. 



I noticed there are bios updates on gigabytes website ( http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4133#bios ) but am aware of the risk involved in flashing bios and would like to avoid it if at all possible. Not to mention I'm unaware if any difference exists in the fact my card is an XFX, though I doubt it would make a difference.


Also noteworthy, sometimes when I start my computer the GPU fan will be louder than other times, which can be fixed by restarting.


It doesn't seem to be an overheating issue, and the PSU of 750 watts should be enough for this system.

Motherboard: Asrock A75M-HVS |
Proc : AMD A4-3300 APU with Radeon HD Graphics, 2.5GHz |
RAM : 4GB |
GPU : Sapphire Radeon HD6850 |
OS : Win 7 |


So my problem is, that compared to another rig i have (i3 proc, 4GB ram, Nvidia 650Ti ) , it seems to be doing too poorly while playing Warframe(https://warframe.com/), which should not be the case. The FPS regularly drops to 12fps during the height of the action while the other rig never goes below 30fps while also employing higher game settings than the problematic rig. I've tried lowering game settings to no avail. It still drops regularly to 12fps.


So, will buying another GPU and employing crossfire solve this issue? If so, will another 6850 do and will my existing hardware support it?"

So, my motherboard recently died, and when I was replacing it, I ended up breaking some CPU pins on my Phenom II x4 965 thanks to the thermal compound AMD included which I am convinced is actually cement.

So, now I've got a new AM3+ motherboard, and need to grab a new CPU. I've heard that the Bulldozer architecture got a lot of flak, and even the W7 hotfixes didn't completely solve things. 

Other relevant components include a SSD and a couple of 7200rpms, 16gb DDR3, and a 1gb HD 6850 card. Motherboard is the [Gigabyte GA-970A-UD3P.](http://www.gigabyte.us/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4717#ov) Like I said, this isn't a high-end rig, but I'd like it to be serviceable.

So I could go with the FX-4130 for $60, or get the FX-8320 for $100. $40 doesn't seem like a huge difference for a processor that I've read good things about, but I don't want to throw the money down the drain if the 4130 will do.

Amd,hotfuzzen,6,3,"AMD Troubleshooting.**The problem:** I updated my AMD HD 6700 series driver last night, and I a black bar on the left and top of my screen appeared. I think the black bars appeared because the screen may have shifted for some reason.

**What i have tried:**  Trying to get rid of the black bars I checked my resolution and it hasn't changed from 1920x1080. I went into the Catalyst Control Center and nothing seemed to change their either. The display is 1920x1080.

Right now I have disabled the AMD driver, so i can actually view my desktop. 

I then went to image scaling and starting playing with it, and that seemed to make it much much worse. My screen stopped displaying anything at all and decided to show ""Invalid Format"" on it.

I went to safe mode (only way i could see a display) and deleted the drivers, and reinstalled them. This did not fix the problem either. It just looks like a super zoomed in version of my desktop. I can't even see the start menu bar. 

I am clueless and would like your help. If you have experienced this problem before, or maybe have some suggestions please let me know. If there is another place to post this where i can get better help, please let me know. Thanks.

I've two PCs, one with a GTX 560 and one with R9 280X. The R9 280X can barely handle Borderlands 2 on medium with Physx on highest while my GTX 560 could handle it on highest settings and Physx on highest. The same goes with Tomb Raider (except obviously the 280X is a 3GB one year old card while the 560 is a 1GB 4 years old card and 280X supports tressfx more) but the 560 could actually handle Tressfx really good (still got framedrops but not as much as 280X got framedrops to BL2)

Amd,danhakimi,13,2,"Radeon HD 6630m Drivers and Windows 8.1 -- Help?I'm having some weird problems, and I was wondering if you guys could help me with them... because Sony won't, and I doubt AMD will be any help.

I have a Vaio SE with a Radeon 6630m in it. It has a graphics switch that's supposed to switch between integrated to AMD graphics. The integrated graphics suck.

I used it on Windows 7 for a while, and didn't have any problems until about this time last year, when I'd reinstalled windows, installed the latest drivers, and... weird things happen. I began to experience lag when playing League of Legends, videos started stuttering, and I couldn't change my Windows theme colors -- my explorer bar was perpetually stuck transparent blue. I was pretty sure this was AMD drivers. But whatever -- I made do with that.

Then, I installed Windows 8.1. By default (IE, before drivers), my screen resolution seemed messed up (said 1920*1080, but everything was sized a little too large), LoL and some other things wouldn't start up at all, Netflix (Windows 8 App) wouldn't play, and I couldn't change brightness (super low by default).

So I installed the drivers, and things... changed. The resolution was mostly fixed, lol got to a further stage before crashing, and I could change the brightness, but not with the keyboard brightness control (only through windows 8), and Netflix was still broken, giving an error about protected video which I basically traced down to my driver.

I installed the integrated graphics driver over it, and everything was technically fixed, but super slow because, you know, integrated graphics. It would be practically impossible to play LoL, and things would look shitty.

I installed the AMD driver back, and the problems with it all came back.

I tried installing an older version of the AMD driver (from back when it was working for me on Windows 7), and that caused me to bluescreen, and then bluescreen again on restart until Windows 8 said ""crap, guess you need to system restore to yesterday when you installed the damn OS."" And then it did that, and now I'm back to the no-driver state.

Anybody have any idea what I should do now?

EDIT:

Okay, I installed the same drivers again, and... They seem to be working. Uh... I'll let you know if that changes.

Edit2: Crap, no, I restarted, and I'm having roughly the same problems again. I should also say, catalyst control center crashed as soon as I started it up. I can't find CCC in the start menu now, although I could before (and it would crash again as soon as I restarted it)."
Amd,Va_Fungool,9,2,"R9 290 HDMI audioso I use to have a HD 6970, before upgrading to a r9 290.  The way my Home Theater has always worked was I had an HDMI cable directly connecting my 6970 GPU to my Onkyo 605 HDMI home theater receiver.  It worked beatifully, I would bitstream DTS-HD and DOLBY HD through that HDMI connection when watching Blu-rays.

Since upgrading to the r9 290, I notice that the driver package does not even contain a driver for the HDMI port anymore.  Instead now Windows automatically installs a default HDMI driver developed by Mircrosoft and its only limited to 2 channel audio.  Its total crap.

I was wondering if anyone else experienced this problem.  Is this a driver issue?

Another issue is game specific. In The Witcher 2, I'm getting great FPS until I ""talk"" to an NPC and the game zooms in on them. The textures seem to have trouble loading at this point, and drastically slows down until all the textures are loaded. Then it runs well until I talk to the next NPC. I found out that this problem is solved however, when I run OCCT along with TW2 while having OCCT's GPU memory usage cranked up to about a gig. This suspects me to think the card doesn't recognize TW2's memory usage or something.

___

I know it sounds weird but I've been having driver crashes constantly this week. Today I decided to roll back to AMD 13.9 drivers to be able to play games.

The drivers got installed perfectly and I rebooted the system. When I returned, I instantly got ""AMD updated your outdated drivers to 13.12""

I checked the folder and found a bunch (around 40) of ""AMD 13.12"" folders!

I did a driver sweep and went back to the website to install 13.9 again, but they instantly installed 13.12 again!

Why are AMD doing this? The 13.12 drivers is clearly broken and I can't even boot up a game without getting ""AMD 13.12 drivers has stopped working"" error!

I'm seriously concidering selling my 280X now for a GTX 770 if this keeps going! If I can't play games on my graphics card and I'm too young to start with bitcoin mining (wich most likely won't work neither) then what's the point of keeping it?

And yes, I've been talking to AMD support wich really wasn't a big help since all they did was sending me a link to the 13.9 drivers wich got replaced instantly by 13.12.

The company could request for it to be made compatible with current sockets (preferably FM2+) or custom-made ones to lessen the shortcomings of current sockets/chipsets, then that company sells those custom-made CPUs out into the market. What I am just not sure of is if it is possible to have a contract such as this with AMD, since AMD could turn down the contract and make these plans themselves.

Second, my PC recognizes that something is attached, and even labels it ""Panasonic-TV"" (I have a second monitor connected via DVI so I can troubleshoot). Under ""Screen Resolution"" the display is locked/off, and no settings can be changed. However, under CCC I can enable the display and change the settings, but the TV still doesn't display anything.

The TV does not have any PC drivers to download, and just uses the ""Generic PnP Monitor"" driver.

What do you guys think could be the issue? I even tried a second HDMI to no avail, so I don't think it's that, nor the TV, which leads me to the video card.

Amd,There_Went_The_King,6,6,"Radeon HD 7950 Driver ProblemsJust bought and tried to play BF4 and before I could do anything, it told me to update drivers. (13.4 to 13.9)

After trying to two days to get them to update correctly, I'm out of ideas. I've looked everywhere online and can't seem to find anyone with similar issues. 

I've tried installing the 13.9 drivers, the 13.11 beta, and rolling back to 13.4 to see if it would work, and nothing has.

I've been getting several different errors, and can't run most games with them. 

Sometimes, my computer won't recognize my graphics card anymore, and just installs drivers as ""Standard VGA Graphics Adapater"". Usually I can get rid of that by uninstalling drivers, and allowing Windows to automatically install on a reboot. If it does recognize the card after that, I always end up with an error that says the driver is unsigned, or the drivers install correctly but they are the 13.4 drivers and not the 13.9 or 13.11 drivers, so I still can't do anything.

I've been trying to fix this for two days, but nothing seems to help at all. I've tried re-downloading drivers, driver cleaners, deleting everything related to the AMD drivers.

If anyone has any ideas to help, that would be appreciated.

Amd,The_CarRan,1,0,"Looking Ahead: AMD CoolersIf one looks into the state of AMD coolers, many say that AMD coolers are either sub-par or good enough, and that applies when the owner does not tweak anything; see news about AMD Radeon R9-290X reference cooler for more details. Having simple and easy-to-manufacture coolers drives costs down, and pushes the development of better coolers to third-party solutions, but what about if AMD suddenly steps up in designing their coolers (CPU and GPU-wise)?

In my opinion, investing a bit more on GPU coolers will also indirectly improve their designs for stock CPU coolers, and this would lead to better value for buyers in the long run. Doing this would also force third-party solutions to step up and further improve on their cooler designs, which would mean another win for consumers.

So, what do you guys think? Will investing a bit more in designing better stock coolers be beneficial for both AMD and consumers? Or, will it not be a good investment as of the moment, given that AMD is strapped in cash at the present?"

I Feel Like A PC Noob Again With CCC.So yeah, with the BF4 Beta being horrendously under-performing on my GTX 770s in SLI, hardly ever staying above 60 FPS on Ultra, I grabbed an HD 7990 from Sapphire for £450 thanks to the price cut as a test.

I told myself I'd send it back, free of charge and get my money back within 30 days.

And I confess I haven't seen much improvement.

Specs as usually requested:

* ASUS Sabertooth Z77 Motherboard.
* I7 3770k @ 4.5ghz
* 16gb DDR3 Corsair Vengeance RAM @ 1600hz.
* Sapphire AMD HD 7990 6GB.
* Corsair HX850 PSU.
* Samsung 840 256gb SSD.
* Asus Xonar Phoebus Soundcard.
* Corsair 650D case.

I wiped Windows 7 and started again, so I don't have any other games installed yet to test in.  I didn't have much on my PC anyway, and it only takes like an hour to get BF back up and running again.

I have run Unigine Valley and get an FPS of around 80 on the Extreme HD setting, which is roughly the same as the SLI 770s which are £150 more (worth keeping the 7990 then) I think, if I remember right.

Anyway.

I have just installed the Windows 8.1 preview to see if anything changes, as apparently its' the way to go for better performance, but have yet to test any games as I'm at work now and only finished downloading this morning.

In Windows 7, before I installed Windows 8.1, I noticed some strange things that lead me to question whether the card is running how it should:

* GPU-Z shows the card has 2 GPUs, good, but I can only monitor the GPU Load on one of them.
* GPU and VRM Temps exceed 80c, Vrm going to 84.6c at its' highest.  That just seems really hot.

But this bugged me the most:

* After installing Windows 8.1 and the latest 13.11 beta drivers, I was prompted in CCC after the restart to enable Crossfire.  This...didn't happen in Windows 7.  This now makes me question whether or not the 2nd GPU is working, and the fact that I can't monitor the load of it on GPU-Z suggests I may be right?

Now, Unigine shows you your GPU figures when running.  What core and memory hz, and the temps and FPS.

Mine only shows 1 GPU.  Should it only be showing 1?

CCC is quite different to Nvidia's control panel, so I was wondering if someone could walk me through some of the basics of what should be selected for the 7990 to make sure its' working right, as I'm really confused.

------------------------------------

Regarding BF4 itself, I enabled the overlay graph to show the GPU and CPU graphs.

Running the 13.11 beta drivers.

With the 770s, I was running green and yellow almost overlapping.

With this beast 7990, the green graph is way above the yellow, suggesting there is no problems.  I'd only have problems if the green was BELOW the yellow.

GPU-Z showed a 99% max load.  CPU around 70% load.  Good signs?

But I WAS still only seeing FPS figures, at 1080p, of minimum 30s, highs of 160, and average around 50.

The new DICE update that has caused everyone's PCs to see massive improvements has done nothing for mine.

----------------------------------

As I said I've yet to test any games in Windows 8, but I did do a Unigine Valley run as I was waiting for BF4 to download.

Same FPS/result as I got in Windows 7.

I may try the 13.10 drivers.

I really, really, really hope I see a performance jump after switching to Windows 8.1 like everyone else is experiencing, otherwise I'm stumped.

[GPU-Z Pic](http://i.imgur.com/g7xVjRf.png)

This should work on all cards that share the same PCB and Features (e.g. the card mentioned above and others). You must however make sure the BIOS is from the same vendor AND shares the same Device ID. (Subsytem ID won't matter though). This DOES NOT work on stock HD7970 cards since they use a completely different PCB. And since most of them don't even have a Dual BIOS switch you'll end up with a nice doorholder.

And by the way, this also appears to have fixed the artifacts by reducing the memory clock."

Amd,TechnoBill2k12,0,1,"I'm asking for help... I installed the 13.10 Beta2 Drivers and now Aero won't turn on.EDIT: I fixed it!  Despite trying everything under the sun while trying to fix this, it ended up having the easiest fix of all time. All I had to do was change my bit depth from 32 to 16, and then back to 32...then Aero came back and all is good!  So glad I didn't resort to reinstalling windows :)


I was excited to install the AMD 13.10 beta 2 drivers on a Radeon 6950 Windows 7 setup so I could see what the difference would be for Battlefield 4. I was somewhat worried during the installation by a ""driver not signed"" warning, but continued on with the process believing that it was because the driver was still beta and not certified yet.

Up until this point I have not had a single issue with my Windows 7 install, and have kept up-to-date with the AMD drivers.

However, much to my chagrin, after I installed the beta drivers I have no way of turning on transparency for Aero.

Also, I've noticed that the windows desktop is no longer accelerated; significant tearing while scrolling browser windows occurs, and it seems like it's being rendered by the CPU instead of the GPU.

Battlefield 4 plays fine though, windowed 3D games (Starmade for example) work just fine as well.

I have tried multiple auto-fix helpers, checked my power settings (even though it's a desktop), tried uninstalling the beta and rolling back to the previous drivers, used system restore points (unfortunately don't have a restore point before the beta), driver cleaners, reg-fixes, Aero-forcers, system file verification...everything except for a windows OS reinstallation. I've clean-booted, made sure dwm.exe is running, restarted uxsms, and looked through every forum I can find to try to see what the hell could possibly be going on.

The Microsoft Fix-It utility (from the  Windows Support site) runs through the diagnosis and reports back that my video card does not support Aero, although when I run the Windows Experience Index benchmark it comes back with a Aero score of 7.8. The build-in Aero troubleshooter finds no problems with the card or drivers. This is so confusing!

I have access to all Aero themes in Personalization, and everything other than transparency and acceleration are working when I switch between Basic and Aero modes. The checkmark for Transparency is not available when looking at the Window Color option. This is despite that all related services for Aero are enabled and running.

Is there a file in windows which can be missed by all of these checks and fixes but which if corrupted or of the incorrect version will make windows Aero not work?

Has anyone ever been able to fix this problem without reinstalling Windows?

Thanks in advance for whatever help you can give!

EDIT: I should mention that during all of this I've reloaded the v13.9 drivers, but am still having the problem."

Planning on triple monitor, probably all 1920x1080, but game on one monitor. Wondering 3GB will be okay if i get the 280x.

will 280x be huge upgrade from gtx 570? just go for 290x?

SOUND: HIGH DEFINITION ON-BOARD 7.1 AUDIO

When testing the new PC myself, I ran into issues where the CPU was underclocking/undervolting itself under load. To be clear, I don't mean that the issue is that it was doing this when idle; I understand that this behavior is normal. I mean I would run Prime95 and within about 5 minutes it would underclock itself to 1400MHz and remain at this clockspeed until I stopped Prime95.

After numerous exchanges with their customer service department and bringing the PC in for an RMA, they replaced both the CPU and the CPU cooler; while it is not remaining at 1400MHz anymore, it is still periodically dropping to 1400MHz for a few seconds at a time while under full load, maybe every 2 minutes or so.

I am being told by CyberpowerPC, after they checked with a senior tech, that this is normal for high end AMD CPUs like the FX-8350. Fortunately, I haven't played any games that make heavy enough use of the CPU to trigger this issue but I suspect I would see periodic drops in my framerate if I ever did.

Basically, I need to know if they are right and this is normal behavior of the CPU or if they are full of it. If it is the latter, I intend to link them to this Reddit post and demand an explanation, so please be as detailed as possible if you think they are mistaken."

Amd,thexcguy,13,4,"FX-4350 vs A10-6800kHi all,

I'm looking at building a machine for software development and light gaming, probably running Linux. I've looked at benchmarks for both the FX-4350 and the A10-6800k, and like that they are both very overclockable chips.  My gaming needs would probably be satisfied well by the APU's integrated chip, so I was just wondering if the use of integrated graphics on the APU causes some sort of performance hit for non-graphics activities.  In other words, given that the A10-6800k is roughly the same price as the FX-4350, is there any good reason to go with the latter?

I realize /r/buildapc is generally a better place for questions like this one, but I'm not going to be building for a while.

However, for some reason, every time I start my PC up again, I have to re-install the drivers for them to take effect.

Amd,[deleted],0,1,"BSOD at Catalyst uninstall? Drivers I can helpI wanted to share my recent experience.  I was having some issues with BF3, one of the suggestions was to uninstall the cap profiles and drivers and do a clean install of the drivers.  Well long story short, it turns out to be a bug in the BF3 patch, but in the process of uninstalling my drivers, I borked my system.

I googled my issue and found lots of people with my problem, but my solution, as simple as it was, was never mentioned.

So what happens for some people when they use the Catalyst Install Manager to uninstall everything is the system sees a BSOD in the middle of the install.  After a restart, Windows then sees another BSOD at startup and the user is forced to go into safemode and use driver sweeper to remove the drivers.

After this, however, installing the drivers again ends in a message saying there were ""warnings.""  Then, trying to load up CCC gives messages like ""Can not load file or assembly MOM.implementation"" or ""CLI.implementation"".

So basically the solution is this:  Go back to your Catalyst Install Manager, and do a custom uninstall.  Select everything EXCEPT the drivers.  Once uninstall is complete, go to your hardware list, right click on your video card(s) and select uninstall driver.  Restart into safe mode, driver sweeper on the ATI drivers, then load back up into Windows.  After this, use CCleaner to remove junk entries from your registry, and use the uninstall list under ""tools"" in CCleaner to uninstall the Catalyst Install Manager.

Now you can run your driver installer and it will install everything correctly.

Most drivers should be available through the manufacturer, and I've never had an issue downgrading before. I was so wrong, it isn't even funny.

I've managed to install everything but the USB 3.0 and the Graphics driver. Surprisingly it states that the SM Bus Controller is installed for some reason. I've sat here trying every version of CCC I can imagine, up to the beta 13.8, which stated that it had support for the HD8330 that is integrated into the APU. Nope... no luck. I've got resolution up to 1600x900, but no Windows Aero. Device Manager lists the display as a Standard VGA graphics adapter.

I've tried pointing Windows to 64 bit .inf files... nothing... I've tried pointing it to the CCC 13.8 Driver installation directory... nothing.

I'm not usually one to ask for help, but I'm hoping somebody has run into this issue before. I know the APU for this unit is brand spanking new, but you'd imagine if it can support WDDM for Windows 8, why can't it support it for Windows 7?

Not really a question as sharing a weird experience.At work I have 2 1680x1050 monitors and we have an AMD Radeon HD6350 connected to 2 monitors via a DVI to 2x VGA splitter.  I was running my screens extended but decided to mess around with Eyefinity just to pass some time since I work a school helpdesk and we aren't in session at the moment.  I installed Catylist Control Center and set up the 3360x1050 Eyefinity group.  It was cool but not very practical so I decided to just get rid of the CCC and stick with the extended monitors.  I uninstalled the program with the Eyfinity group still setup and it stayed even after getting rid of the CCC software.  From my understanding you have to have the software to set up an Eyefinity group.  The odd thing is that it counted as a duplicated desktop.  Now when I go to duplicated desktop I can set it to 1680x1050 and it works as normal but I can also step it up to 3360x1050 and it recreates my Eyefinity group as a ""Duplicated Desktop"" setup but in reality it is the Eyefinity settings and running as a single monitor.

ASUS M5A97 Motherboard
500w psu
2x HiS HD 7770 ghz edition.

My problem is, in a lot of games, I'm seeing the same or lower performance.

For example in BF3, I'm only getting about 30 fps on ultra with crossfire enabled.

In skyrim, I get 30fps on high, without crossfire I get around 50

Other games are pretty much the same.


Anyone know what might be the cause? "

Amd,omniuni,12,8,"I think the Windows Experience Index is rigged against AMD.Today, while comparing the Intel HD 4000 graphics to the 7660G in my notebook, I was shocked to discover how apparently close these cards rank in the Windows Experience Index.

The Intel HD 4000 scores 5.6 and 6.4 on Graphics and Gaming respectively.

The RadeonHD 7660G scores 6.7 and 6.7 respectively.

According to this, the RadeonHD is only 19% faster for ""graphics"" and about 5% faster for ""gaming graphics"".

The Intel card has 16 pipelines and clocks at 350-1350mhz. That high a clock speed can't be great for power consumption, but apparently it helps with WEI. The 7660G has 384(!) pipelines, and clocks in at 497-686mhz. Even if we assume that the higher clock speed gives the Intel card the ability to do three times the amount of work per pipeline, which I highly doubt, the RadeonHD still has about eight times the processing power.

XFX Pro 550W

I tried to install the ones from amd site (A series for Windows 7 32bit) and indeed in the release notes http://support.amd.com/us/kbarticles/Pages/AMDCatalyst13-4WINReleaseNotes.aspx there's not the gpu of my apu (8570D), and in fact my monitor goes black randomly every 2 or 3 seconds. If I use the autodetect driver downloader, it says it can't find my product. I uninstalled everything AMD related, even using the specific uninstaller from AMD site.

I tried to install the beta drivers, but the screen becomes completely messy. Could it be that the integrated GPU is faulty? If no drivers are installed, it works just fine, but it obviously can't run games.

DxDiag recognize the cpu and the integrated gpu.

What should I do?

I'm just looking for some info from anyone that's done any RMAs through AMD. I'm trying to RMA my A8 5600K Due to CPU overheating issues. I've done all the tests to narrow down and confirm it was a cpu issue, and before the thought of, 'Did you OC, not provide proper cooling, etc. etc.' I have plenty of open airflow and have worked on PCs for several years now, so all the cooling stuff was adequate and properly attached.

Anyways I've tried to do the RMA twice now. the first time about 3-4 weeks ago, and I got to the second automated email, within 24 hours, then nothing else. This time I've once again gotten the second automated email, and still nothing. So, is this normal wait for AMD?

I've always had AMDs either just work right, or arrive DOA so when there had been issues it was ship back to whomever it was purchased from. So no experience with AMD.
