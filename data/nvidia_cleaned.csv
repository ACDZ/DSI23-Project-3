nvidia,snorkles01,0,1,"Buzzing sound from 3060 Ti FEI just got my 3060 Ti FE installed a couple days ago and it runs great except for a slight buzzing noise. It sounds almost exactly like coil whine so initially that's what I thought it was until I realized it goes away when the fans are at 0 rpm.

I've checked them and can't see any wires or casing that would be hitting the fans while they operate so I'm not sure what could be causing the noise? Does anyone have an FE card with a similar issue? It's not very loud but it can be a bit annoying and ramps up with the fan speed. Wondering if there's anything else I can do to troubleshoot or if it's worth trying to get an RMA."
nvidia,dolemite79,4,1,"System crash now no video signal from evga 3080So I've had my 3080 since November, no issues gaming or doing anything on it.

I was playing a game tonight and all of the sudden my system crashed.

When it booted back up there was no video signal.

I had it connected via hdmi to a lg c1 48.

I pulled out my old acer predator and plugged it in via display port and still no signal.

Tried clearing cmos, tried leaving system unplugged for over 15 mins. 

Have no idea what's going on. Temps were normal, right before crash (about 63 degrees) theres no ozone smell or anything that would suggest the card shorted out but I'm seriously at a loss here.

System specs
Gigabyte x570 aorus master
Ryzen 5900x
32 gb gskill ram

I haven't modified any settings lately or updated any drivers or bios. Everything posts fine during boot up with no error codes but not matter what port or monitor I try there's no signal. 

Ugh. 

Any advice? I'm worried my card is dead."
nvidia,makisekurisudesu,12,1,"DLSS in Necromunda Hired Gun Image Quality Comparison - Better than Native in all resolutions?I think what I want to like the clarity, aliasing stuff say can be told just by these images, but there's one thing I have to point out.

&amp;#x200B;

Notice in P1 comparison, there're some white lines on the boxes below the "" Use 44"", in Native 1080P and Native 1440P image you almost can't see these white lines. 

You can see why these details aren't sharpened or imagined by the Nvidia AI in the Native 4K image, it does exist in a higher resolution, but they're well preserved even in the DLSS 1080P Image.

&amp;#x200B;

Or in P5 comparison with the details on the skull in the red circles, watch the circled spots carefully in the 4 images. In DLSS Quality mode the dirt on the skulls seems like a map of a continent, but in Native 1440P mode it's much more simplified. This ""continent"" of course still exists in the Native 4K Image which once again proves that these details aren't there because of mere sharpening.

This game according to AMD would also support FSR in the future, I'm really interested into how these two compare.

Doing a cursory check on https://www.techpowerup.com/vgabios/ most nvidia cards manufactured before 2013 lack a UEFI bios, and ergo cannot be booted with UEFI and as such are incompatible with a TPM enabled system.

The issue is similar on the AMD side... with most r9 290 GPUs lacking UEFI support, while many r9 390 vbioses do...

Your only recourse is potentially flashing your card's vbios to a newer one off techpowerup's site of the same make and model!"

The issue I am facing is low GPU usage in CS GO.
I was facing in game strutters so I decided to benchmark.

I ran the benchmark map of cs go along with Quick CPU utility and found out that CPU temps were hitting 95°C. So I under-volted and under clocked the CPU. This reduced the strutters and 
 CPU now ran around 80°C with some loss in FPS of course.
1280 * 960 res benchmark showed 280+ fps.

The interesting thing was only 20% of my gpu is getting used and its running a lot more cool at around 60°C. 

Is there a way to use more GPU in CS GO. BTW I am using external monitor Acer 165Hz.
So I switched to GPU scaling in Nvidia CP instead of Display Scaling. This improved the Graphics quality a bit but GPU usage was almost similar.

nvidia,ima420r,0,1,"GTX 1080 with two monitors, one won't go to standby properly when PC is shut off.I have a GTX 1080 with 2 monitors and a TV plugged in, along with a VR headset. I have no issues with the TV or VR. When I shut down my PC, the main display turns off fine, but the second one keeps trying to find a signal. It gets bright for a few moment, doesn't find a signal, and turns off. Then it does it again. I have looked into Windows 10 settings and can't find any info on something to do to fix this, so I wondered if it was hardware related. 

Does anyone else have this issue? Does anyone know how to get both monitors to turn off and stay off when I shut down my PC. I have unplugged the TV and VR and nothing changes, so I don't think they have anything to do with the issue. I have also swapped the monitors (the cables at least) and changed which is primary and it's always the same: primary stays on, secondary keeps trying to find a signal.

It gets kind of annoying to see the monitor light up every few minutes, then shut off again. I hope someone here might have a suggestion or two.

nvidia,Jeffy29,2,1,"Nvidia really needs to notify you about ""optimizing"" game settingsSo I was playing Siege with a friend and after few games, I started noticing some weird issues with my game, my aim was off and everything, I turned on afterburner OSD and sure enough my framerate was going up and down 70-90 fps, which I don't have since my 3080 runs it at locked 165fps with plenty of headroom, but the utilization was at 100% so I was dumbfounded. I started Kombustor to check what's my framerate there and it was fine, I started Warzone and the same thing with the siege, even worse, the framerate dropping from 70fps to 20fps, big performance drops. At first glance, all my settings looked fine.

I restarted my computer thinking it was maybe some weird issue, of course, it didn't fix it. I started thinking maybe I have some secret mining bot running in the background and it's stealing my GPU performance (lol) or even worse than my GPU is crapping its pants and in the current market, I would be fucked. 

After a lot of trial and error, I randomly went to the Nvidia control panel to check game settings, and then I noticed **DSR was turned on globally at 2X**. And of course Geforce experience ""optimized"" all my games so Siege was running at 5120x2880 and for good measure it also had 4xTAA turned on! Because that totally makes sense!

Then I remembered that I completely wiped my drivers with DDU a few days ago because I had errors in GeForce and it wouldn't open. So when I installed fresh drivers it did this by it's own because I forgot to turn off ingame optimization. And I can live with that, it's just ingame settings, but DSR globally at 2X?? I can guarantee you my non-techie friends would never find where is the issue, they barely know what the Nvidia control panel is much less DSR. 

I find all this optimization pretty useless, games these days are pretty adept at detecting and giving you decent settings by themselves. But if you desperately want to have this feature, at least give us big button to turn it on/off during geforce installation process. And for love of god don't turn on anything in Nvidia Control Panel, you are just hurting your own customer base, 95% of people who have GPUs just install the drivers and never touch anything else and don't know anything about it.

Also another big reason I find their ""optimized settings"" useless because they always target 60+fps so 70-80fps on average to compensate for the framedrops. So if it sees that you have performance overhead so it cranks up AA or DSR even though it's completely pointless. So if you have high refresh rate monitor the settings are just crap because it's much better to play at 140fps than 70fps that looks 0.1% better. At least give us choice to pick to what refresh rate should the settings optimize to."

I currently have the [2060 EVGA ko utlra](https://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=06G-P4-2068-KR)

I want to buy 2 [120mm noctua fans](https://www.amazon.ca/Noctua-NF-F12-PWM-Cooling-Fan/dp/B00650P2ZC) and ziptie strap them to the gpu.

So, how do I control these fans according to the gpu temps? 

I don't want to plug these into the motherboard directly and then use argus monitor cause I don't want to pay a yearly license to use that software. 

So it seems that people recommend buying something like this [pwm cable](https://www.amazon.com/CRJ-Splitter-Adapter-Sleeved-Graphics/dp/B07T95C68T/ref=pd_lpo_23_t_0/141-3991807-9555916?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=B07T95C68T&amp;pd_rd_r=432cf895-15a4-429f-bfb8-2ae7b6ac6672&amp;pd_rd_w=ugmTH&amp;pd_rd_wg=LwtsV&amp;pf_rd_p=fb1e266d-b690-4b4f-b71c-bd35e5395976&amp;pf_rd_r=XJ7PB5NRQWN02Y2KJ5A3&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=XJ7PB5NRQWN02Y2KJ5A3) and then plugging the fans into that adapter thing. 

My question is that, is it as simple as taking the gpu apart, plugging that adapter into the fan header (on the gpu pcb) and then plug in the 2 noctua fans in the end of the adapter? And then I can use msi afterburner to control the noctua fan speeds according to gpu temps? Sorry if this is unclear, I am sort of confused my self.

Started out as occasional loss of video signal from day one that it would soon recover from (and the PC would keep running fine).  Then it moved up to loss of signal that it would NOT recover from until a reboot - sometimes causing the PC to hard reboot.  Checked every connection, reseated the card a few times.  The basics I could do without tearing EVERYTHING apart.

For a Level Set   
I7900K | 32 Gig Ram | MSI Motherboard | RIADMAX Vampire 800 W PSU | Coming from a no problem RTX 2060 Super

So, I finally RMAed the card on May 27, received it back on 6/25 with no notes as to what the problem was when it was returned.  It was not  new/refurbished card, but my card.  They had just tested it.  While it in for repair, all I had was on old Gigabyte GTX 1070 laying around that filled in fine.

So when I got the 3080 back I reinstalled, booted up.  No video signal.  I played with it a little bit, swapped out the two display port connected monitors into to opposite ports as well as the HDMI cable to my third monitor and it booted up fine...thought that was strange.  I gamed on it for about 2 hours - no problem.  Then, I let the PC sleep, came back an hour later, no video signal and spent about an hour moving things around swapping the power connectors into different ports on the card, nothing.  

So eventually I removed the 3080 and started to put the 1070 back in.  Of course, the 1070 only required one of the three power pin cables.  Tried to boot and got a black screen just saying ""Please Connect Power Cable to your GPU""

Bingo.  We checked the power cables.  ONE of the three power cables to the modular power supply was SLIGHTLY loose, and apparently slowly working it's way out.  Had checked this before, and upon a quick ""hand tight"" inspection they had up to that point all seemed fine.  It never even occurred to me that the card would work at all if any of the Power Cables was not supplying power to card...and unlike the 1070 I never got an on screen message alerting me to the problem.  It's been running fine for 2 days no with no  problems AT ALL.  I'm out the $56 I spent to ship/insure the card sending it back to Gigabyte.  Well worth it for peace of mind.

Do I feel like an idiot?  YES.  But I've seen various posts over the months I've had the card with people reporting similar loss of video signal issues while I was trying to figure it out, so if this helps anyone...check and double check your PSU cables!  I got lucky in the 3080 ""Refresh Your Screen"" sweepstakes back in February, and I'm incredibly happy even through all the intense BS Nvidia is pulling now in the market for these.  If you refuse to buy one even when availability opens up just on principle, I understand.  But I can honestly say in 20+ years now of buying GPUs (remember installing my first Voodoo 3), the RTX3080 is the only one of countless card purchases over the years that has performed way BEYOND my expectations."
nvidia,Cblan1224,46,1,"Anyone else running through a 2020 denon avr, with or without the new hdmi 2.1 adapter?I'd like to hear some experiences on VRR passthrough for those who have the new adapter. I have an x4700h, and I really can't believe how hard it is to get all these devices to work together. I can't even get atmos to work for more than 5 minutes without cutting out. I disabled my motherboards onboard audio, yet it still switches back and forth between windows sonic and Dolby atmos, for no apparent reason. 

Regardless, the topic was suppose to be VRR. I want to hear what people think. I just ran flight simulator above 60fps and it still seems choppy. I'm wondering if I need to extend my desktop and use the denon for audio and just connect to my gsync compatible oled. This opens up another can of worms..not being able to duplicate and keep hdr, not being able to turn off a monitor and still use it as an audio source, full screen-extend issues.

I gotta say..it took me almost a year to get all these things. All these speakers, subs, amps, full blown home theater, big oled...and I built a monster pc with a 3090 that does not seem to do anything right. Between windows and denon, I'm quite pissed. Though I gave up on denon long ago, and am mostly looking at windows.

So before I do the whole...club 3d 1085 adapter/extend desktop deal...does anyone have vrr working through a denon? Maybe flight simulator is just messy, though i don't remember it being so.

Thanks"

nvidia,knightsljx,1,1,"The mysterious 139MHz problemHi, my 4 years old 1080 Ti started to encounter serious performance hits (like single digit FPS) and I realized it was down clocking to 139MHz on the Core Clock during games.

After much googling, it seems this is a very common, very old problem that has never been definitively solved.

Various proposed solutions that do not work include
-DDU and reinstall latest drivers 
-rolling back drivers
-uninstalling Afterburner
-changing power management settings in Nvidia Control

The most plausible explanation seems to point towards a power phase issue that isn't delivering enough power to the chip during a high load and the gpu just down clocks itself to 139MHz.

I'm currently trying to get it RMA-ed. In the mean time, I've found an interim solution that would still allow me to game. I've underclocked the card by - 90MHz in Afterburner, and I limit the FPS in-game where possible. This seems to allow the card to run stably with a small performance hit, rather than not being able to game at all.

As for now, my PC has a 2060, Intel 15-11400f and 16GB 3.600Mhz RAM. I got some extra money this month and tought about upgrading my GPU.

I usually play on my monitor at 144hz 1080p and sometimes on the living room TV, at a higher resolution (1440p/4k) but more family fun, less demanding games.

I have three options that are priced almost the same and fit my current budget: ROG Strix 1080ti, Galax 2070s or EVGA 3060. 

Unfortunately, high end cards like the 3070, 3080, 3090 are completely overpriced where I live, so they are not an option (the 3090 is 4 times the cost of the 3060).

nvidia,Teranis2000,0,1,"RGB and Fan control on ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 3090/3080Hello,

I got my hands on an ASUS ROG STRIX RTX 3090 OC white edition and water-cooled it. Because I like the look of the cooler from ASUS I want to rebuild it. I was wondering how the RGB-LEDs from the cooler are powered. Here is what I found out:

The black header connects to a board and looks very similar to a regular aRGB header. (4 pin header but only 3 cables attached)

The white header has 7 pins and runs towards the fans. Somewhere, it is separated. 4 cables run towards each fan separately. My guess would be that this is a custom PWM header. The fans probably get a regular PWM signal. However, I have no ideas what the 7 pins do.

Also, the RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 seem to be almost identical boar layouts (except the back), so I also assume that ASUS is using the same cooler for both.

Can anyone confirm my assumptions about the black header and give additional information bout the white header? Or redirect me to a post or additional information?"

What do you think ?"

nvidia,spiroth123,1,1,"so, lets have the ever dreaded discussion about why exactly these drivers suck and shouldve been deprecated 15 years ago from a dev/user perspectivewhile I realize 90% of the market is between muh games and data centers on the linux side of things. we have some serious problems worse than just the wayland issue.  


lets talk about the basics first -- vdpau. while its still being knuckle dragged for literally everything, its not really the official video codec anymore -- nvdec is. but this is almost entirely undocumented and unsupported.  


by the grace of god, someone hacked together hardware video decode with nvdec and CUDA into mpv. literally 100% of all other video players on unix platforms lack any vp9/10 decoding and any updates to video codecs at all so its about 15 years outdated and probably very inefficient.  


if it wasnt for wrapper daisy chaining and using unsupported build options, chrome wouldnt even have last-gen capable hardware acceleration at all. not for scrolling, not for video decode, nothing.  
thank god for hax.  


literally at this point, even if most consumers and non-developers think ""it works! and I have my apps I need!"" anyone who REALLY knows how their system is working knows they have a very tedious configuration held together with unsupported bubble-gum and elmers glue under the hood.  


half a decade after release the company cant be bothered to properly update vdpau or even just make it a symbolic link to nvdec internally to support vp9/10. so we have incomplete, probably buggy, undocumented apis to even make use of modern features possible.  


these are features that, if someone even wanted to support them (being nonstandard and a PITA), they really cant because you'd have to be a super-expert to do so and deal with things that arent even openly exposed by the driver.  


compound this with dragging along x11 and refusing to accept a standard that requires the same kind of effort im talking about above, eventually the state of most things is going to decay to an unusable state where people dont update these features at all in the limited places they are available.  


theres a lot more problems than just wayland support and GBM. and the absolute truth nvidia needs to accept in this new generation is the old model of cheap ported drivers cant work anymore. it honestly didnt work 5 years ago with the whole vdpau debacle.  


the time has long come for a unique unix driver to be written that conforms to whatever standards and provides a complete mesa and GBM compatible wrapper -- at cost to nvidia for development. you dont need to develop all the software but you absolutely must give us a wrapper. and nvdec needs to be completed and totally replace vdpau in 10 series cards and up to finally give these cards vp9/10 support. I mean, if you keep dragging it on, even 30 series cards wont have support for codecs lmao.  


yes this means a lot of overhead cost. but this is just ridiculous. as a user and someone who writes software, the current strategy you're going the rest of the industry and the rest of the users have had it with you on this side of the OS sphere. you wont get support from coders without doing what I said. ever. the only way to do it your way is to literally hire even more people than i suggest and at cost start building your own open source port system which is even more unrealistic to do (assigning gnome and kde teams constantly -- plus this would mean no other wms once x11 is totally deprecated as main windowing system would ever support the cards without you hiring specific teams)  


it just wont work the way you want it to. on windows and mac it doesnt work because you're FORCED to code drivers to the OS standard. now that one has been established, your pm screwed into it or else. for now its fine but it cant last much longer anymore.  


im glad to see efforts at least being made in some way on the front of wayland, but tbh since you keep doing things the way you want, not everyone else, i still have severe doubts even that will work. People might have been willing to accept alternate codepaths if they were constantly stable and equally bugtested with no hidden apis or video decoders and the full feature set.  


but the truth is you've soured everyone to that because we already know you cant be bothered to support it properly at all anyway."

2. also doesnt have any resale value due being portess.
3. Takes away production line from gaming cards

nvidia,lokkenjp,22,1,"Windows10 21H1 performance on a GTX 1070Ti Pascal GPU (466.47 WHQL Driver based)Hello, fellow redditors.

Following the same format of my regular Early Performance Benchmark Driver threads, I've decided to run a few quick benchies of the latest Windows 10 21H1 OS update on my Asus 1070Ti GPU, and compare them with the results I got using the previous Win10 OS revision (20H2).

I haven't been offered yet the update via the regular Windows Update system (as usual, Microsoft is deploying the 21H1 update on ""waves""), so I've used Microsft Media Creation Tool to install the new release. After 21H1 was installed, I wiped clean the drivers using DDU and installed the same 466.47 drivers again from scratch, just to be sure that nothing got messed up with the update.

As usual, the benchmark PC specs are: custom built desktop running Win10 v21H1 (latest non-optional Windows Updates applied), 16Gb DDR3-1600 Ram, Intel i7-4790k, Asus Strix GTX 1070Ti Adv. Binned, single BenQ 1080p 60hz. monitor with no HDR nor G-Sync. Stock clocks on both CPU and GPU. Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS for short) is enabled.

Frame Times are recorded using PresentMon (except on TD2 which does it by itself) during the built-in benchmark run inside each game. Each benchmark is run initially four times, and the first result is discarded. Outliers results, with more than 5% variance in any of my used metrics from the average, are also discarded and repeated.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, games run 1080p borderless windowed, best settings as possible while trying to hover above 60 FPS, but all available 'cinematic' options disabled when available, (like Motion Blur, Chromatic Aberration, Film Grain, Vignette effects, Depth of Field, and such, not due to performance but for my own preference and image quality reasons).

The usual disclaimer: This is NOT an exhaustive benchmark, just some quick numbers and my own subjective impressions. Also, I can only judge for my own custom PC configuration. Any other hardware setup, different nVidia architecture, OS version, different settings... may (and will) give you different results.

&amp;nbsp;

**Important:** Frames per Second (FPS) are better the *higher* they are, and they usually show the ""overall"" performance of the game. Frame Times (measured in milliseconds) are better the *lower* they are; in particular, lower Frame Time percentiles tell us how much GPU time is needed to render the slowest and more complex frames, with bigger values meaning slowdowns, potential stutters and puntual lag spikes for a less smooth gameplay. _I'm now including also the percentage differences in the latest driver vs. the previous one (with the sign '+' denoting an improvement, and '-' meaning worse result)._

*******

## Tom Clancy's: The Division 2 WoNY
Using updated Snowdrop Engine with Dx12. High/Ultra settings (except Volumetric Fog set to medium).

The Division 2 - driver 466.47 on W10 v20H2:

* Avg. FPS: 87.54 / 86.67 / 87.26

* Frametimes: Avg. 11.47 - Low 1% 15.27 - Low 0.1% 18.10

The Division 2 - driver 466.47 on W10 v21H1:

* Avg. FPS: 85.74 / 85.76 / 85.41

* Frametimes: Avg. 11.68 _(-1.80%)_ - Low 1% 15.17  _(+0.66%)_ - Low 0.1% 17.93 _(+0.95%)_

While the average framerate on The Division 2 is slightly worse, the difference is quite small, and what's more important, the lower frametime percentiles are in fact a bit better now. So, even if the game is slightly slower overall, there are now less potential stutters and lag spikes, while the framerate is kept a bit more stable.

********

## Ghost Recon: Wildlands
Using the AnvilNext 2 engine on Dx11. Mostly V.High but no Gameworks options enabled.

GR: Wildlands - driver 466.47 on W10 v20H2:

* Avg FPS: 85.12 / 84.32 / 84.99

* Frametimes: Avg. 11.79 - Low 1% 15.73 - Low 0.1% 18.62

GR: Wildlands - driver 466.47 on W10 v21H1:

* Avg FPS: 84.01 / 83.96 / 84.70

* Frametimes: Avg. 11.87 _(-0.67%)_ - Low 1% 15.51 _(+1.42%)_ - Low 0.1% 18.66 _(-0.21%)_

Ghost Recon Wildlands behaves similarly to The Division 2. Average framerate is a hair slower, the lower 1% frametime percentile is a bit better, while the lower 0.1% frametime percentile is almost the same. In all, some numbers go up, some down, but changes are small enough to not be of concern.

********

## FarCry 5
A Dunia Engine Dx11 game (a heavily modified fork of the original CryEngine). Maxed Ultra settings with TAA and FoV 90.

FarCry 5 - driver 466.47 on W10 v20H2:

* Avg FPS: 91.41 / 90.15 / 90.68

* Frametimes: Avg. 11.02 - Low 1% 14.77 - Low 0.1% 16.23

FarCry 5 - driver 466.47 on W10 v21H1:

* Avg FPS: 91.75 / 89.40 / 90.99

* Frametimes: Avg. 11.03 _(-0.09%)_ - Low 1% 14.73 _(+0.27%)_ - Low 0.1% 16.40 _(-1.03%)_

FarCry 5 is pretty stable between both Windows revisions. Almost no changes in average framerate and in the lower 1% percentile: the lower 0.1% is a bit worse, but difference is just small enough that it may be very well just testing noise.

*******

## World of Tanks Encore RT
A dedicated benchmark tool for the new Dx11 game engine developed by Wargaming internally for their World of Tanks game, including hardware-agnostic Raytraced shadows. Config is set up to Ultra setting, with Raytracing enabled at Ultra too.

WoT - driver 466.47 on W10 v20H2:

* Avg FPS: 103.73 / 103.98 / 103.93

* Frametimes: Avg. 9.63 - Low 1% 15.02 - Low 0.1% 16.02

WoT - driver 466.47 on W10 v21H1:

* Avg FPS: 102.26 / 102.54 / 102.74

* Frametimes: Avg. 9.75 _(-1.23%)_ - Low 1% 15.22 _(-1.31%)_ - Low 0.1% 16.31 _(-1.77%)_

WOT is the first game in which we get a consistent result... in a bad way. All metrics are slightly worse here. Nothing big, but every single number is now lower than before. :(

*******

## Forza Horizon 4
A Dx12 game from Microsoft, using the propietary Forzatech engine. All quality options maxed, but Motion blur disabled, and just 4x Antialiasing.

FH4 - driver 466.47 on W10 v20H2:

* Avg FPS: 97.92 / 98.10 / 98.20

* Frametimes: Avg. 10.20 - Low 1% 13.16 - Low 0.1% 15.17

FH4 - driver 466.47 on W10 v21H1:

* Avg FPS: 96.08 / 95.66 / 96.21

* Frametimes: Avg. 10.42 _(-2.11%)_ - Low 1% 13.58 _(-3.09%)_ - Low 0.1% 15.46 _(-1.87%)_ 

Forza Horizon 4 gets also a small hit in performance like WoT on all metrics. This is usually the most stable game of my testing suite between nVidia drivers, so it's surprising that just the OS change make such a difference in FH4.

*******

## Bonus Track: Assassin's Creed Odyssey
A Dx11 game from Ubisoft, using the same AnvilNext 2 Engine of Wildlands, but with a slightly newer version. Quality options are High preset, except for AA and Volumetric Clouds set to Medium.

AC:O - driver 466.47 on W10 v20H2:

* Avg FPS: 62.10 / 64.93 / 62.84

* Frametimes: Avg. 15.81 - Low 1% 23.82 - Low 0.1% 28.39

AC:O - driver 466.47 on W10 v21H1:

* Avg FPS: 60.68 / 62.90 / 62.61

* Frametimes: Avg. 16.12 _(-1.92%)_ - Low 1% 25.16 _(-5.32%)_ - Low 0.1% 29.98 _(-5.30%)_ 

And this is the reason why I don't like the Assassins Creed games for Benchmarking. Even between runs of the same betch with exactly the same setup and the same drivers and OS version, the built-in benchmark give results with an enormous amount of variance. I had to take *5* full runs on each batch just to get 3 of them within the same values. The other runs had one of more metrics varying more than 5% of the other averages in that same batch.

Given this, I honestly don't know if the results here are significative or not. The trend is clearly downwards, but I cannot be sure if that's because of the OS change, or it is just because the embedded benchmark awful variance.

*******
&amp;nbsp;

**System stability testing with the new OS Version**

My list of usually tested games (besides the ones benchmarked above) are running fine with the new OS revision: FarCry: New Dawn, Anno 2205, Anno 1800, BattleTech, Diablo 3, StarCraft2, World of Warcraft (both Retail and Classic), Marvel's Avengers, Elite:Dangerous Horizons, AC: Odyssey, Horizon Zero Dawn and Mass Effect Legendary Edition (short testing game sessions). All ran fine without crashing or obvious glitches on my setup.

&amp;nbsp;

**OS 21H1 performance testing results on a Pascal GPU**

Out of the 5 tested games, 6 if we count AC:Odyssey, we have three technical draws (TD2, Wildlands and FC5) and two clear losses (WoT Encore and FH4), plus big losses too on AC:Odyssey, if we ignore the fact that its benchmark seems awfully designed and gives so much variance between otherwise identical runs.

Ironically, for my 1070Ti card the game with the biggest loss in performance due to the Windows 10 upgrade is Microsoft's own game, Forza Horizon 4; which is surprising given that this game is usually the most stable of the ones I use for testing my Pascal 1070Ti GPU.

Given that Microsoft newest OS update is not a big deal, if you have a Pascal 10XX GPU and a similar setup to mine I'd not be in a hurry to update. If you already got it installed, then you might see slightly lower performance on some games, but nothing major. 

The OS update itself only contais a few changes here and there, the new awful ""News and Weather"" widget in the Task Bar, and as far as I know nothing else besides a few under the hood optimizations. Unfortunately, it seems none of those under the hood optimizations improve the gaming experience under Windows 10.

In the end, I guess the W10 21H2 feature update later this year will be much more exciting. It includes a crapload of changes and new features, and a new Windows Driver Model (WDDM v2.8 if I recall it correctly), which will surely impact performance in a much bigger way (for better or worse).

&amp;nbsp;

Last but not least, remember this benchmark is done with a Pascal 1070Ti GPU. Cards with a different architecture (be it newer or older) may show wildly different results.

nvidia,raistandmuadib,27,1,"G-Sync settings for 4K 60Hz + RTX3080?Hi all,

I read the blurbesters gsync guide but can't say I understood all of it and have some Q's. My setup is an i9-9900 (non-k) + RTX3080 +  Samsung U28E590D (4k 60Hz). I mostly play pubg so I prefer higher fps and lower input lag over tear-free visuals.

If I understand correctly gsync effectively aligns frames while reducing input lag, but I need your help to understand:

1) what will gsync give me i'm getting consistent 59-60FPS with vsync off (which is slightly annoying but not sure i would want to lose 3 fps just to get rid of vsync)?

2) does gsync basically replace vsync but with less input lag?

3) basically trying to understand if there is any benefit with my current screen or if it will be more effective (and less noticeable fps drop) if i upgrade to a 120+ hz screen?

4) If I upgrade to a new screen is full gsync needed or is gsync compatible enough?

Thanks!"

Hello -

Thank you in advance for any help you can offer :) I will try to keep this as short as possible so here we go.

For reference I am running a i9-10900k, 64gb 3600 ram, and EVGA 3090. I have this hooked up to an LG TV that maxes out at 120hz.

I used to have a 3080 and had issues where out of nowhere I would get 30-40 FPS for weeks/months on Call of Duty Cold War. Nothing I did fixed it. I tried formatting the PC, reinstalling shaders, uninstalling drivers with DDU, rolling back to earlier drivers, updating BIOS, and turning off any in-game overlay. I am not sure what I did but one day it actually started to work again. For reference I would get 110-120 FPS without the issue. 

I recently had my buddy swap my 3080 for a 3090 and he formatted my PC. After installing everything again I booted up Cold War and the issue came back. With the 3090 I was making out at 40 FPS. 

Nothing I can find online has helped me fix it this time around. I made sure to leave my overlay off and I believe my NVIDIA settings are the same from prior format. 

If anybody can help me find the reason why this is happening I would sincerely appreciate it. I know some people have said this game has a memory leak issue and I genuinely believe that may be what it is as my other games are working great but I just don’t know how to fix it.

Again, thank you so much for reading this and for any help you can possibly offer. I am not too knowledgeable when it comes to PCs so if you do have an advance fix please let me know how to do it.

Thanks!"

nvidia,pcquestionable,6,1,"How to attach case fan to top of Zotac 3090 OCHello,

Like many others I am getting very high VRAM temperatures when gaming or mining.  I experimented by blasting a cold hair dryer at various points on the card and found there was quickly a 5-10degree reduction in VRAM temps when cooling the top/middle of card as highlighted in photo, so I would like to try to add a 80mm or maybe even 120mm fan here, pointing straight down.  I would be targetting cooling the top plate itself but also getting some air into the grille/slots where it says ""Live to game"" as seen better on the second photo.

What would be the best way to acheive this ?

Is it possible to simply lay a fan on top and tape it on with thermal tape or something liek that?  I'm not too worried about aesthetics...  I wouldn't want to use anything that leaves any permanent marks on the card, in case I need to RMA.  Thanks !

The first post I found the EVGA forum that said not to use that fan header or it’d lead to power draw issues with the card, and another person saying that it’s fine if you solder something together to just use one of the pin.

All other mentions of the header online seems to agree that it’s fine to put a case fan to it, but I’m not getting enough confirmation that using a splitter on it is 100% safe!

I’ve got the Lian Li o11 with 3 bottom case fans. I got that case specifically to feed fresh air to the GPU, and now I’m really tempted to link them to the GPU, but I don’t want to fry the card that will have to last me the next 10 years probably!

nvidia,Queasy-Zebr,0,1,"RTX 3070 ""grinding"" sound, and random 2 second black screenOccasionally my EVGA RTX3070 XC3 makes a sound that  I can at best describe sounds like as if the fan knicks some internal component briefly and makes a grinding noise. It is not loud, it is fairly faint but it is pretty obvious. I am curious if maybe a fan is lose and occasionally spins on an angle slightly that may cause it to bump into something else, or if this may be something completely different. 

The other thing I noticed is I randomly get a black screen. It is as if the display cable was disconnected, because the screen goes dark for 2-3 seconds then when it comes back on I see my display setting on the monitor pop up which is what it does when the cable was plugged back in after being unplugged. As this issue is hard to recreate, I am not sure if this is coming from the GPU side or somewhere else.

Curious if this may be an error because I only have one 8-pin power cable running to the GPU? With my PSU and cabling, it can easily deliver 220w to the card even though NVIDIA recommends running two. But I have even experienced a black screen utilizing less than 30% of my GPU so I do not believe that is the problem.

In a country where average monthly salary is less than 1000$ (I'm from eastern EU). And this is from an official retailer.  WTF?

They claimed they have stock, so it's not like a preorder price. They literally have cards, but they are not selling it because of the 500% MSRP. Why is this even allowed? It was already bad when people bought off stock and sold it at inflated prices, but now it's the official retailers that doing it? I know NVIDIA cannot control stores directly, but they can influence them heavily. (saying that you cannot sell our products 500% MSRP or we will find another store as official retailer)"

nvidia,Manes1v9,6,1,"gpu error crashes while using streamlabs/playing league of legends (rtx 2080 super)Hi guys, I have a serious problem with crash / gpu error for a few months now that is hitting my nervous system.

Build PC: [https://it.pcpartpicker.com/list/gVBfzN](https://it.pcpartpicker.com/list/gVBfzN)

Initially the crashes only occurred when I streamlabs on twitch while playing League of Legends and practically the PC crashed randomly with a black screen and no error windows. The game just started running and then black screen. I noticed that every time during these crashes, in the task manager processes the use of the memory of google chrome jumped to 90% and in fact even in the second screen I could not change the browser page or scroll the page or change the song on the spotify page. In practice, even google chrome lagged a bang.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, however, the crashes are more intense and always randomly. Since I updated the drivers (maybe?) Now a fixed error screen comes out but the PC no longer crashes so much that it has to be restarted but it always crashes with a black screen but restarting the League of Legends game client the problem is solved and returns to normal.

I also noticed that the game client now has a ""flicker"" effect when it is loading the game before entering the game and the same effect happens when altabbo to browse the browser or just go to the desktop.

&amp;#x200B;

I noticed that 2 times it crashed while hi-booting but I can't be 100% sure that it is related to the crashes and memory peaks used in the pc.

&amp;#x200B;

In short, I don't know what fish to take.

&amp;#x200B;

The error windows that appear are:

Most common: ""GPU Error Windows has restarted your graphics processor driver due to a problem, driver update, or physical card removal. League of Legends will close.""

Others: ""windows has restarted your graphics processor driver due to a problem, driver update, or physical card removal."" and the same but in English.

&amp;#x200B;

I have tried everything: I have lowered the quality settings of the game client and streamlabs, I have updated the drivers, I have reinstalled them cleanly. I disassembled and reassembled the video card, cleaned the pc even if it has 0 dust, disabled some pc settings that suggested in various reddit posts where they had a problem with my similar error.

&amp;#x200B;

But nothing.

Do you have any solutions to propose before you completely clear up?

Thanks in advance and sorry for the incorrect English."
nvidia,Bastinazus,4,1,"Zotac 3060ti Twin Edge OC, possible ""faulty"" chipHello.

I managed to get this GPU model like 3 months ago. I have tried to undervolt it to improve temperatures and performance but, apparently I got a bad quality chip. I get crashes in almost every game when I set something like 0.950mV and 1950MHz (a pretty small undervolt, considering all the people who have achieved way better undervolts), which left me with a sour sensation.

Currently my settings are 1.00mV at 1965MHz. I don't think if that could be even considered an undervolt attempt, honestly, maybe a slightly better than stock, but that's it. If I go further, I begin to experience crashes while gaming. 

Should I assume I just got unlucky with my chip? I have read a lot of people here posting outstanding stable undervolt settings, something like 0.900mV @ 1980MHz. I would RMA mine, but it's virtually impossible to get a new 3060ti right now due to market shortage."

I've tried the minor steps that I've seen online like replacing the thermal pads on the back plate, stuck some small heat sinks on the backplate, and added a small fan to try to cool them. This seems to have worked a little, but still hitting those crazy temps. I believe part of the problem is that the backplate on this card is plastic.

I plan on upgrading to a modular 750w PSU eventually because the 3070 is just a placeholder until I can find a 3080, it would just be nice if I could wait until I actually have the 3080 to upgrade the PSU.

nvidia,peladine,5,2,"Gigabyte Gaming OC RTX 3070 vs Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 3070?Sorry if this is in the wrong place!

Somehow over the past couple days I got very lucky and managed to pick up both a Gigabyte Gaming OC RTX 3070 (£600, £60 over MSRP) and a Nvidia Founders Edition RTX 3070 (£480, MSRP + delivery) for my build. I'm having trouble deciding which card to actually keep. I'm upgrading from a GTX 670 which I got 8 years ago, so either would be a sizeable upgrade. 

I'm hoping to be playing recent AAA games at 1080p for now, but I'm trying to future-proof as much as possible. It seems like the only real advantage to the Gigabyte version is a very slight performance increase as well as slightly cooler temperatures, but I'm not really sure if this would be detectable when gaming. Both cards are also within my total PC build budget, but if I can save 20% of the cost for a very similar experience, I'd rather do so. 

What do you guys think? Is the extra cost of the Gigabyte card worth it?"

nvidia,margenov,4,0,"A tale of two 3070sAround October I decided to get a 3070 and eventually get something better when the prices settle down ( KEKW ). Around November 13th I managed to order a Gigabyte 3070 Vision OC for 660 Euro, they charged my card, but later the funds were returned ( or so I thought ). While I was still rocking a RX 570 in wait for the new GPUs I talked to some friends with local connections and managed to get a Gainward 3070 Phoenix GS OC for 605 euro ( cheapest 3070 I've seen anywhere in Europe since November 15th ). Fast forward to December 1st I get an email that the Vision 3070 is being shipped to me and my card got charged. 
I'm like oh well, I will sell the old one to someone, people will get it regardless. Now a sidenote, since locally we don't have a good supply and prices on many things I often order from Germany through a middleman, however around Black Friday and Christmas shopping that middleman got dunked with 5-10 times their usual orders and now the waiting begun. I had 10 orders going through them, half arrived locally in their warehouse on december 8th, the rest on december 15th. 
I was hoping I could get my stuff for Christmas but that didn't happen. I went to their office on December 29th to see a 40 people line out in the cold ( the line starts inside, so it's around 60 people ).

1 month later their develiry called me and finally I got all the stuff I ordered back in November/Early december.
https://i.imgur.com/VbRXfuS.jpg

Now I have two 3070s, will test how the Vision does and will sell the old one. 
https://i.imgur.com/xa10B81.jpg 

My question is should I sell the older one to a miner for more money( 700-750 euro ), maybe make an auction ( like ebay ) or just sell it for around 650 euro ( it's last reasonable MSRP )."

Long story short.  Disable all of your audio in sound properties apart from microphone, this should allow the conflicting audio to stop messing with it and allow it to load.  Then re-enable them all and you can use it as you were.

It's a pain but it's a workaround for now if you do so happen to have this problem like me.


I've spoken with the senior product manager Gerardo who was super helpful and has informed me he has passed this onto the software engineers. No ETA on a fix though.

6 GB GTX 1060 GPU  
Initially, it was performing well, I could run most games at a stable 70 FPS, and games like FIFA, NBA 2K at 120+ FPS. Only on Battlefield V, the fps came in the range of 45-60. But now, I am having pretty low fps on most games. Currently:

Apex Legends : 1280x720 res, lowest settings, 45-75 fps, during intense fights, even dropping to 30ish

Minecraft : (With Sildurs Vibrant Medium Shaders), 1440p windowed, low settings with clouds and god rays off, 50-65 fps

NBA 2K19 : 720p, Windowed Mode, Lowest settings with only Floor Reflections on, 60-70 fps, with lags where it drops down to 30-40 fps

CS GO : 1080p, Lowest settings with only Textures High, 110 fps, sometimes dropping to 80.

It currently has a 512GB SSD, a 1TB SSD and 4TB HDD. One of those drives uses the DVD drive sata cable since there were no other SATA cables left. Therefore, the power that usually goes to the DVD drive is simply allocated to a hard disk, and no power it's still the same.

For example, I've noticed a considerable boost in FPS, graphics and overall hardware performance, especially in first person shooters.

But, when I put the DP-in cable with the Intel GPU it works, the screen, I mean. Now even with the NVIDIA GPU running in the tower, the Device Manager couldn't find anything, just the Intel GPU. I've tried downloading the driver back again, but with no prevail. The driver itself said that it is not compatible with my system, even though the NVIDIA GPU is still running. Can someone tell me what's going on with my pc?  Is my NVIDIA GPU dead?"

nvidia,FlailingAndFailing,10,1,"Upgrading from a 10 series to a 30 series - What's the right driver process?For the last many years, I've been running on a 1080 Ti - including when I moved forward onto a new mobo/cpu/psu combination two years ago. Today I got SUPER lucky, and scored a TUF 3090. I'm starting to prepare to execute the upgrade, but I realized I'm not sure how to handle the software side of things. 

I had a few questions, and I was hoping someone might be able to provide some insight:

1) What's the proper order of handling the drivers? Uninstall the existing drivers, shut down the system, swap the card, and then power on, install new drivers? Should I install the card BEFORE uninstalling the drivers? Windows 10 tends to get overzelous about applying drivers immediately if they are missing, so I don't know if I can even pre-empt that.

2) I currently use an EVGA 1080 Ti, and so I run Precision X1. Should I uninstall this, since I'll be moving to an ASUS TUF card? What can I use to set fan curve and monitor temperatures now that I'm no longer using an EVGA card? I don't think ASUS makes a similar product.

3) Is it a MUST that I use DDU when moving from one card to another? I've seen some people say DON'T use DDU unless you absolutely need to, and encounter a problem. I've seen some people say you MUST use DDU, or else you WILL encounter problems. I don't know what to think.

I got an msi 3080 suprim x graphics card, installed the beta version of msi afterburner and maxed my power limit and temp limit (116% and 91°c) 

In games and benchmarks i reach 58°c max but still afterburner gives me sudden temp limits (0 to 1) on the temp limit graphic.
I double checked with log files from hwinfo64 and gpuz and the temps never spike up but they both say i reached temp limit or percap reason thermal at the same time i get the temp limit 1 in afterburner.

I never see any throttling happen and everything plays smooth so i am not sure why 3 programs give me temp limit reached...

Is this a faulty temp sensor or is there something else i could check ?

I send an email to MSI support, they asked me to do a clean install of the drivers.
After i did this the thermal limit spikes only happened whenever i opened or closed a stress test or benchmark program and not anymore in the middle of a gaming session.
The respond i got from MSI was this:
Wish you a happy life.

I replied that for an expensive card this is not normal behavior to give me thermal limit reached when never going over 58°c.

Do any of you also get thermal limit 0 to 1 or perfcap reason thermal even though your gpu never hits your temperature limit ? Just need some reassurance.

After a couple hours I installed GE as I wanted to get some recordings and from the get go, the game was stuttering ever 5 seconds and dropping to about 20 FPS.

Recently, all but one of the ports on the video card died, leaving me with just one HDMI port - the integrated HDMI port on the motherboard doesn't work either, so now I have one main monitor on a substandard port and a second monitor hooked up to nothing that works.

This sounds like high time to get a new video card. Right now I have a plain GTX 1660 6GB card, and with RTX cards coming out it seems like the upgrade path to go to. The 30*0 cards are definitely too expensive right now, so a 20*0 card with maybe 8GB of RAM would be a solid upgrade. I do not want to by used, but refurbished is fine if it includes a good warrantyl

What are the most affordable quality cards in this range? The closer to $300 I can get would be best, even if it means dropping down to a 10*0, but having RTX would be nice. :)

In my head the 3080 was intended to be a pleasant gaming experience at 4k with ray tracing somewhere around 60 fps (w/ DLSS if available). However, I have been having several issues attaining that in most games ive been playing. 

PC setup - AMD 2700X, 3080 gaming x trio, 16 GB 3200 Ram, 2 TB SSD, 850W PSU. During all my games my CPU is &lt; 50% utilization with low temps and the 3080 is at 100% with temps in mid to low 70s.

For all my games, I'll go with the NVIDIA geforce experience recommended settings. In most cases this is 4K at ultra settings &amp; DLSS on (if available).

First game - COD Black ops cold war. Things look pretty good for the first mission but pretty much anything after that would tank down to 20 FPS and eventually crash. I'm thinking this one is a bit of huge issues with the game as others are having similar issues, but unsure.

Second game- Metro exodus - FPS sits around 50 but will stutter down to 40 from time to time. Seen several crash issues which i didnt expect with a game of this age.

3rd game- Horizon zero dawn- best experience so far with able to hang on at 60 FPS but will randomly stutter down to 30 FPS and then recover.

Is this a common experience?  Is 4K at 60 FPS w/ DLSS not an expectation? Are there other games out there with great graphics that have better experiences?"

I looked around on google and didn't seem to find anything useful so, here I am.

to be more specific, I recently bought ark from steam and in-game I noticed that the performance was rather awful, absolutely not what it should've been with a 3070 inside. well it turns out that the game doesn't even use the 3070 at all, and focuses solely on the CPU for whatever reason.

I understand that this is most likely the game's issue, and I've already posted on it's own subreddit. 

but I thought that perhaps I could get some extra help here too, to avoid something like this in the future with any other games or programs.

nvidia,spacev3gan,10,1,"Are prices really going to drop for the 30 series anytime soon? Is it worth waiting?Firstly, I personally live in one region that cards are always overpriced to being with, mostly to do with taxes I reckon. Looking at the 3070 and the 3080 cards and comparing them to the 2070 super and 2080 super cards, I would say the 30 series cards are a good 50 euros marked up in comparison, maybe 100 euros in extreme cases. So prices are bad, but not prohibitively so.  


That being said, when stock actually meets demand, is it realistic to wait for prices to drop? I remember seeing a video on Gamer's Nexus where it was stated by AIBs that they can't meet Nvidia's MSRP. Another video by Hardware Unboxed told a similar situation on AMD's side.  


While a price drop would be welcoming regardless, I am afraid that if/when that happens, we are talking months into the future, possibly a year. From my experience, while the market responds to price increases very quickly, prices drops tend to take much more time.

Solution: The actual steps may vary but the idea is forcing your PCIe slot to gen 3 or gen 4. By default, my Gigabyte X570 aorus elite has PCIe Slot Configuration set to AUTO. In reality, it's running on gen 2! I found out about this on GPU-Z dash. By going to Bios -  Settings - Miscellaneous Settings - PCIe Slot Configuration, I manually set it to Gen 4, now my RTX 3090 is finally free and time to game. 

This won't help every single one who's having issue out there but I wish I could help as many folks as possible so y'all don't have to go through what I go through. Cheers."

Does anyone know what happened to the 3k series FE cards in AUS? After flipping back and forth forever, Nvidia decided they would sell their FE cards in Australia, through Mwave. Short time later, they're listed, and they hold a raffle so people have a fair and even chance of being able to get a launch day card. So everything's sorted then, right?

Well no, I've been checking for stock \~daily after I didn't win the raffle, but about a week or so ago, all of the FE cards become 'unavailable' and unlisted, the only way to find them being through google itself or a direct link. I've searched a couple of times, and I don't think I've missed anything on Mwave; so what happened? Does anyone here happen to know?

nvidia,Tiger_Tesla,64,1,"Costs and experience so far using EVGA ""Step Up"" to preorder a 3080TLDR: Cost me $917.74 to get a 3080 FTW3 after all taxes and shipping, and I don't get the bundles. But I also get to use a modern card in my new system without FOMO.  


So after another full week of refreshing trying to snag an RTX 3080, I decided to go to Amazon and just buy an RTX 2060. I don't upgrade often and wanted to make this next upgrade last for a while. The RTX 2060 is a big step up from my current 1050TI.  


After purchasing it from Amazon yesterday (369.99 USD) it arrived today. I logged on the EVGA website and registered my new purchase and uploaded my amazon invoice (easy to find on the amazon orders page). Now we get to the true cost of the ""preorder"".  


The fine print is that there are costs to this method. The only model available for the 3080 is the FTW3 ULTRA GAMING, fortunately this was one of the models I was interested in. This model is  $809.99. In addition to the difference, I need to pay for the shipping (splurged for overnight) and taxes on that purchase (they don't credit for taxes or shipping paid for the card being Stepped Up). I also need to send my new card to them, I'll assume a $15 flat rate box to make things easy. Keep in mind they don't cross-ship, so the time I will be without a GPU (or using my old one) is anywhere from 2-4 days  


Ultimately this brings my cost to ""Preorder"" and ""rent"" a 2060 to $395.89 upfront. The total amount paid once I receive my 3080 will have been \~$917.74. I also will not get access to the bundle deal with Watchdogs or Nvidia.  


A small price to pay for the peace of mind of having a passable card in my new system and having the 3080 preordered so I don't have to keep pressing F5. Overall the website made everything pretty easy, although it did feel very ""2000's"" in terms of website design."

I had a question in regards to upgrading my current gpu (1080 ti) to an RTX 3080. I currently have an 6700k which is a few years old. Will I experience any CPU throttling in games if I decide to wait to upgrade my CPU? If so, by how much? Does anyone have a similar CPU who has had the experience so far?

I‘ve seen it in a few private discords now that Nvidia employees are bragging that they can buy 3000 cards at any time because they have loads of cards in stock on their internal store with cards being added and being sold every day. While we their customers have no chance of actually getting a card right now without using paid bots.

Dear Nvidia we hope you realize that the only reason we are still buying your products under those circumstances is a big lack of competition in the graphics cards industry. It’s not that your products are the best out of a big variety ... there is simply only ONE other viable option. So instead of thinking about new ways of how to flex against AMD on a daily basis ... maybe work on you freaking customer service and community experience.

I saved up through my employer health benefits account for 2 years, you earn $ for completing goals and can spend the $ on any gift card you choose. I saved the amazon gift cards that my very sweet mum gifted me on my birthday (5/21) for the last 2 years. I redeemed everything in Best Buy gift cards - $650 worth! I always try to do business with the local Best Buy because I've had good experiences up until now and their warranty policy is great.  


Two days before the 3080 ""launched"" I went to the local Best Buy (Johnson City, TN) to upgrade to a 750w power supply. The rep showed me a 750w that ""would handle the rtx 3080,"" well it didn't have enough pcie connections so I had to take it back. The same rep advised me, while selling me the wrong power supply, that stock would be available in store - but that it might all sell out online and to be ready at midnight to place my order. I was lied to about the time of availability and their inventory. I showed up to the Best Buy store an hour early just in case the website went down, based on a lie, or in case low local demand would have left a few on their shelves. A small group and myself waited in the cold rain for an hour, all wearing our Covid masks, under our umbrellas. The Best Buy reps saw us standing out there, knew that they couldn't do anything for us, and just left us in the cold rain. When they opened their doors they told us to go look on the shelves to see if there were any there. It wasn't until I was half way through the store that the same rep whom had misinformed me a few days earlier told me they didn't get any cards.  


Bestbuy.com lied about availability on the launch date, and I'm sure that they knew there wouldn't be any available. They could have changed the listing to only show ""coming soon,"" or put out a statement... you know, ANYTHING? There still hasn't been ANY word from the company. Now I'm left with $650 in gift cards that I can only spend at Best Buy, and I can't redeem other gift cards with it. So now I can't even try to catch a 3080 where it is available, as a single father I don't make a lot of money which is why I planned for this in advance.  It was the most disappointed I had ever seen my 10 year old son, whom was very excited about Minecraft and Fortnite with RTX.

Looking to the 3000 series as a step 1 of my upgrade of my aging pc.

Thinking about upgrading to either a 3070 or 3080 depending on price performance ratio. I suspect I'll be CPU and PCI express 3 limited, but hopefully will get a nice performance boost. Then in a few months will look to build a new pc with rizen and a new MB (with pci express 4), and move my new RTX over to that machine.

Am I totally crazy for doing this? Or is this a good idea?

My long term plan is to get into VR, and be able to play games without chugging along on FPS. I do have a 4k monitor so being able to game at that res would be a plus. Obviously I know a graphics card upgrade alone won't fix all the issues, especially in CPU heavy games, but want to spread out the cost of a new build.

Also is there really going to be a big difference between the 3070 and the 3080? Bearing in mind my 970 was £300, I'm having a bit of a shock at the massive increase in prices since then.

It introduced an FPS dropping issue that broke the smoothness of my games that no tweaking could fix. My previous driver was stable when I had it, so I used DDU and started fresh with 445.87.

I'm aware of the common wisdom that you should always upgrade to the latest and greatest drivers to fix issues. Well, this hasn't held true for me, and I would say that 6/10 times a new driver breaks my gameplay and sometimes even my system's stability.

What is your approach to graphics drivers? Do you update as soon as possible to the latest driver? What if your current driver is stable and has no problems like it is for me? Is there any pressing need to update other than if a new driver fixes bugs or addresses an issue with a game like Warzone?

nvidia,GentleGenerator,0,1,"Brightness Flickering with G Sync on LG CXHi all. I just upgraded to the LG CX about a week ago. I'm loving it, but I've noticed an issue with PC gaming using G Sync.

I was comparing the TV to my gaming monitor using Assassins Creed Odyssey in a dark scene, and I noticed that the brightness of the entire screen on the LG CX flickers and varies with G Sync enabled. It is very distracting and pretty much makes the G Sync function unusable for me. The problem disappears with G Sync disabled, and does not occur within V Sync i.e. your frame rate exceeds the refresh rate of the display and V Sync caps it. The problem clearly relates to the G Sync function and frametime variances. AC Odyssey has trouble running at high framerates, so I can see the frametime variations while walking through the dark scene in my on screen rivatuner/afterburner graphs. These frametime variations correlate directly with the flickering/brightness fluctuations. I'm running an RTX 2080 Ti at 1440p 120hz. The avg fps tends to hover around 90-100 fps. It's a perfect game for gsync, but this testing exposes a serious flaw in the LG CX implementation. The problem occurs even if I cap the fps to 60 with it still set to 1440p 120hz. As long as the game is within the G Sync range the brightness flickers, even when the frametime is mostly consistent. I've noticed the effect occurring in other games as well. Skyrim Special Edition shows the same brightness flickering in dark scenes when the fps varies in the overworld. Has anyone found a fix for this? I am running the latest firmware on the TV, and the most recent nvidia graphics drivers. I've seen others posting about similar issues, but haven't seen any fixes. I've tried turning the wifi off on the tv, and that did not fix it. It is clearly related to G Sync based on my testing."

I have been struggling with a decision for the past week now. 

I worry that getting a 1660 Super (£210 where I live) will mean I have to upgrade in roughly 12 months, but my budget is the same price as the 2060 or the 2060 KO Ultra (£320) and I could maybe get 2-3 years out of that because I play 1080p and not fussed about ultra everything. DLSS has also really peaked my interest after the death stranding numbers. 

My concern is that I could buy the 2060 now and it would still be equally irrelevant in 12 months time, but frankly have the money now and don't think I will in even a couple of months time so pressed into an immediate decision. What do you guys think? Should I just take the plunge and get a 2060 KO Ultra now?

nvidia,K___reddit,7,1,"HDR in Windows 10 hooked up to a TV...what settings in Nvidia control panel?Most posts I can find on this are years old

It is now 2020, I'm assuming HDR in Windows 10 is less of a pain than it was a few years back.

Hoping to play HDR games like Fallen Order, AC, and Resident Evil without have to meddle around to know I'm getting the best looking image.

For folks who are hooked up to an HDR TV, what settings do you use in Nvidia control panel?

Just leave it at defaults?

RGB?
4:2:2?
8-bit?
10-bit?

Do you manually change the color space on your TV?
I have never found a consensus answer.

nvidia,xXMatt2816Xx,84,1,"Bad EVGA RMA Experience  

My experience with EVGA RMA program from somebody who is in Canada.

June 13th

I noticed a loose capacitor dangling on the PCB of my 1080ti sc black edition, I called EVGA and a RMA was started and approved. A few days later I send my card from Ontario Canada to Brea California via Canada post using the cheapest options with insurance costing me around $50 CAD. Roughly a week later they received my GPU and it was determined to be faulty so a used “certified refurbished” 1080ti sc card was sent to me the same day. 

June 23rd 

I received the card unboxed it and installed it, after about 10 minutes of fire strike it started to artifact. I used DDU to get a fresh install of drivers and downclocked to memory as I was told by support to test the card, and it was still artifacting. The same day another RMA was started and approved. With the GPU being sent back the following day.

July 9th 

The 2nd replacement was sent out a bit later due to the holidays. 

July 13th 

The replacement was delivered and was installed, during testing there was a constant audible buzzing/whine coil while under load (tested in 2 computers with different power supplies) I contact support 2 days to explain my issues. This time I asked for a Cross-shipped RMA which is not usually and option for a 2nd hand owner but was approved because I had already received multiple replacements and was in need of GPU so I could use my computer during summer college classes. I had to put down a deposit of $769 USD so around $1080 CAD after fees ($80 conversion fee). 

July 16th 

My new replacement was shipped, and I received it on July 20th. I open the box to notice the bracket that gets strewed into the case was bent so I contact support, after sending photos I was told to bend it back as this apparently happens quite a bit. After confirming this would not void my warranty, I bend the bracket back and installed the card. This one having the same issue as the, last coil whine (also tested in separated computers) After sending the card back I looked back at some photos and noticed that the original bend caused a portion of the PCB to peel up.

July 22nd 

Another Cross-Shipped RMA began, but this time no deposit was required as a courtesy from EVGA. my replacement was shipped out the same day, and I received it a few days later on July 24th. This one had the same issue as the last ones. After talking to a few support reps I was told coil whine is normal and is tested in there facility with a 2 feet tolerance before the card fails. All these replacements can be heard from across my room in a closed case. Later that day I emailed the EVGA service manager explaining my issue with all the replacements and said I don’t want to have to keep going through the whole RMA cycle on a weekly basis. I mention that I don’t want to keep receiving the same model with a reference PCB as they more than likely will have the same issues. I was told I could get a 1080ti SC2 (same PCB but with 9 thermal censors) after agreeing to that a Advanced RMA was started and sent to me. When I got my new serial number emailed to me I noticed it was the same as all the other ones I had received, so I message the service manger and he apologized says that it was either human or computer error that resulted in this happening. However, after that he mentioned another RMA could be started so I could get the SC2 1080ti instead. At this point I gave up and just kept one of the 4 replacements I got as I dont see this getting any better than it already it.

My biggest issue with this is that my card that I had purchased second hand from a friend was used for only 3 months and kept in its box most of its life and had non of these issues, therefor I would hope to expect my replacement to not be worse than my original card but that was not the case.

The conclusion to this is if you are in Canada and have to RMA any EVGA product get ready to pay for shipping and possible collateral deposits that will cost you money, in my case $130 CAD total and in return I got a buzzing bumble bee in my computer with a fading led logo."

nvidia,IAmCuenin,4,1,"Might buy the Nvidia Shield TV Pro, question about GamestreamSo I want to get a Shield TV Pro. It's 4K, runs Dolby Atmos and HDR10, everything I need to future-proof for a potential home theatre set up in the future. (runs Plex too, which is so cool!) And Gamestream looks awesome! I have a PC with a GTX 1070 and I hear it works great with GTX.

The problem is, GTX is going out the door soon. The card I have is now the MINIMUM requirement to play a new game like Cyberpunk, so very soon my card won't cut it with high-end games. So then my thought was, just get an RTX card, duh. But I hear that RTX has issues with Gamestream when connecting to the Shield Pro.

So my question is basically, are they going to patch that up and make RTX run better with gamestream? Or are they going to have to release a new Shield TV? Obviously, if it's the ladder, I should probably wait on buying the Shield.

nvidia,iggzy,19,1,"Having Some Issues with my new RTX 2080 SuperHey, I hate trying to ask the community for help, but so far my own research and ASUS/Nvidia support hasn't found anything past a 2 week RMA.

I just bought a ROG Strix 2080 Super. Its getting plenty of power, clocking at 2055Mhz max, keeping below 70 degrees even when stressed...but its under performing. I can't run anything with RTX smoothly or with any good frame rate. I've tried the Ghostrunner demo, Deliver Us the Moon, and Mechwarrior 5. Ghostrunner finally got stable-ish but at 30 FPS. Mechwarrior and Deliver Us the Moon hitch a bunch, have really sporadic frame drops, and it doesn't matter what level of RTX, DLSS or even if I drop it to 1080, it still does it. I've got an i7-7700k and 16Gb of 3200 RAM that all is operating appropriately too.

I'm fine with an RMA if needed, and this definitely seems like it should be that. I've done clean installs of the drivers a couple times, updated my mobo bios and no dice. But I figured I should at least ask the Reddit hive mind before I go back to my 950 for 2 weeks of repairs."

So a good 30 min later I boot my PC, everything fine, run Valley Benchmark for around 20 minutes and dear lord what a difference.  


No noise or hardly any noise, no rattling or ticking sound from the fans on the GPU and even better; my max temperature is 53C. My case temperature also dropped a few degrees because of it.  


So to any of you who are stuck with this card, even after RMA, and dont get a refund or want to sell it for a loss, really consider a waterblock and enjoy the silence.  


I must also add that I will never ever buy something from Gigabyte again, so for those looking for an RTX card, DO NOT BUY THE WINDFORCE version as Gigabyte has clearly some kind of design flaw and will keep RMA cards who have this issue instead of just refunding us.  


As I saw a lot of posts on the RTX2060 super and probably this will be one of the more popular RTX cards in the near future, I thought I could share my little story to just let owners of this card and anyone who wants to buy it know that you can watercool it with a bit of tweaking.  


I hope this helped some people out there who have had the same issues, if your card was not affected and you have a good windforce one, be happy that you dont have to mess around with this."

Would it make sense to just wait a couple more months to upgrade my gpu until new graphics cards come out because of the better performance and even the used 2000 series cards seem pretty expensive because of the pandemic I assume. The main downside for waiting is a personal problem which is basically that I probably won't be able to actually use the new cards unless I can find one in person or possibly get it sent off to a relative as I'll return to university most likely assuming I decide to be in person for uni.

I have both Windows 10 and macOS (vanilla Hackintosh) installed on my computer and unfortunately macOS doesn't support any Turing (RTX/GTX 16XX) cards, it does however natively support the GT 710. The idea is to use a GT 710 in macOS and the RTX 2060 in Windows. But swapping monitor cables around every time I want to switch OS's isn't ideal.

So I'm going to upgrade from my little baby (GTX 1060 6GB) to a RTX 2080 ti. A whole new PC with everything that needs, cpu, ram, cooling system etc etc.

I mostly play MMORPGs and make videos/cinematics/machinimas so I want the 4k for better quality but I also like to play from time to time competitive games (Apex Legends, Overwatch etc) and for that 144hz is better.

for example. when playing games out fo nowhere it would stutter real bad... the game would make a weird ass noise... and it would kind of freeze up all together for about 5 seconds. and then go back to normal like nothing happened. so far it happened both in c&amp;c zero hour. and how to survive 2. but i have no played many other games atm for long. and now how to survive two will also start randomly stuttering here and there. and won't stop until the game is restarted. and like i said. had none of these issues prior.

now i notice the new nvidia driver is talking about being optimized for version 2004. well.... 2004 is a buggy mess itself right now. so is it safe to say that we should not be running driver 451.48 until we update to windows 2004? (which i have no intention of doing again for awhile.) or what? so far i just rolled back to 446.14. which im pretty sure is the last driver i had when everything was running top notch with zero issues. and if this brings up enough people talking about it. then ill post back later to let everyone know how things seem to be after rolling back to 446.14. it is real bad when a driver has enough issues to make you think something in your pc is physically failing. and the way it does what i tried to explain.... it makes me worried it may led to physical damage of the gpu if it does it enough."

I am not new to pc hardware or gaming but recently I noticed getting random lag and stuttering effect on GTA 5 online it increased overtime, at first I thought it might be an server issue , a couple of days later for some reason I was playing story mode where I found more and more fps drops . I instantly fired up MSI afterburner and started hardware monitoring and started to see frame-time graph while doing missions , the drops were low like 60-2 with 22-31ms.  I set the game on high priority from task manager and after that it got a little smooth but GTA online is a different story , the fps are low and drops are still very consistent and annoyingly noticeable . It wasn't always like this ,there was a time I remember playing with pretty much all the settings on very high to high with comfortable average fps of mid to low 90s . Now in game settings are turned down totally and I see no difference but the visuals look pretty bad and all maxed out settings is unplayable .

My specs 
Intel core i5 4460 (haswell refresh)
8gb ddr3 1600 ram 
Gtx 1060 6gb graphics card
Motherboard is an HP oem board as I upgraded an office pc .
650watts 80+ gold certified PSU .

Important things I thought I should mention are :
Things I was monitoring were my average CPU , GPU and RAM , temps (system is properly cooled), Frame rate and finally frame-time graph.
My PC is running windows 10 pro and I have optimised it for gaming through YouTube videos ,last optimised in November 2019 after clean installation of windows in a SSD .
I had ran many games smoothly at 120fps or more previously but very recently have I been getting fps drops which smooths out after settings &lt;insert game name here&gt;.exe priority to high from task manager.
Aside from GTA , other games also get similar frame drops but none are as bad as GTA and also I play more GTA so hence used above multiple times as a reference .
Witcher 3 and few others either run perfectly fine when I set priority to high or atleast smooth out to a playable level .

 I don't understand why it is happening like this or why now and not before ? I didn't had to set my games to 'high priority' everytime I want to play them .I didn't understand the problem and couldn't find any similar case online so I resorted to this subreddit hopping for someone to help me .

I don't know if it's a graphics driver issue or windows driver issue hence posting here .

I am very grateful for you to even considering to read my huge post , thank you ."

So, I got my pc back but after using the PC for a week I noticed a weird fan noise and long-story short, found out that both my GPU coolers had their axis broken, they work, they sometimes stop, spin again, make noise, stop and sometimes it works perfectly nice alongside some rattling noise.

I've been searching for solutions to this problem, either buying a new one, smh fixing these if possible and even not using them completely.

&amp;#x200B;

So currently I'm trying not to force my GPU by not playing any games and keeping it below 30ºc, I tried googling and most GPUs can stay at above 80ºc (My graphics card is a GeForce GTX 1060 3GT OC) though I got some people saying I should keep on staying below 30ºc, the reality is that with quarantine and stuff, it's pretty hard to just do literally nothing, so I wanted to know if it was safe for me to go above 30ºc or even 40ºc with the state of both my coolers. Or should I stop completely because the coolers malfunctioning could cause my GPU to die entirely? Which things should I keep in mind or be scared of?

Thanks in advance. &lt;3"

nvidia,Itsremon,3,1,"Terrible Service - Nvidia Store Order (UK)Be careful guys when buying GPU's from the Nvidia store. I am based in the UK and thus can only speak for the UK store. Early last month I had been constantly sniping the website trying to pick up an RTX 2070 SUPER (Founders Edition) and they was always out of stock. Some how one day, they was in stock and I had purchased straight away. 


The buying process was quite simple, however the tracking was completely broken so I wasn't too sure when my GPU would arrive. I was told by email that I would get a password along with order number to search for it on the website tracker, but I had never gotten a password and had to get this resolved. The navigation on the website to get your order is extremely terrible and it is by no means clear for the general consumer, but I managed to get to my order after hours of playing around.


The GPU arrived a couple days later and the next day I had begun setting it up. Now few important things, I already own an RTX 2070 super, MSI variant which I intended to sell at a cheaper price to a cousin and I purely wanted a new one, Founders Edition mainly for the design and looks. Knowing this, it is clear that the 2070S GPU should work with my configuration. 


Upon installation, it did not work at all and there was on display information. The GPU did not even run, it was a dead/faulty/defective GPU, whatever you want to call it. The fans don't even spin, the GPU lights do not turn on. I had done alot of troubleshooting with NVIDIA SUPPORT, and I had asked for a return after many days I had received an email with a RMA information. I had asked for a return, not RMA. I had to contact the Nvidia store again and after another few days, I received a return label from a company that Nvidia work with in the UK, Digital River  l and I had gone to the post office to send the item back. It was then evident that the return label sent, did not work at all.


I had to contact Nvidia again telling them the return label does not work, in which they replied 'Why was you not able to post it earlier'. I literally just told them. They then replied, 'We are working on your case, we will get back to you'. This seemed like an automated response as it has been 4 days since then. I had to contact Nvidia 5 times in total and still no resolution. I am hoping this gets resolved soon but just be careful guys when purchasing items from their store in the UK. It has been nearly 30 days since I have been holding a broken GPU."

I'm not really interested in a full loop setup for this build, just a hybrid. So I couple of questions/request of input.  


\- It seems like all the kits EVGA sells are for the bigger cards (FTW3) - I'm guessing that's not something I can make fit.

  
\- The Kraken G12 looks like I can ""make"" fit (possibly with some modification - I am fairly handy, so not scared of some diy fwiw) - is this the best option? Alternatives?

\- Can I get away with a smaller radiator/fan/block (single 120 or 140) and still be in the 50° range under load? I've got the room (Cooler Master H500) for a bigger radiator, but why if a single would do it. (also take suggestions on which one to pick up)

\- Assuming whatever kit (g12/etc) I use doesn't cover the whole card, what is the opinion on the cards memory being uncovered? I've got some unused small heatsinks from a few raspberry pi projects, or I could probably rig a small fan to the side of it... or just leave it alone?   


Overall, just looking for a noise drop more than anything. With the stable overclock I'm able to get on this card, I'm power limited vs. heat as it is, so not super worried about performance gains (although I suppose if it stayed in the 50's the boost clock would stay maxed)

I have 2 monitors; main is 144hz g-sync compatible, second is only 60hz.  I've tried many different suggestions and settings but I can't seem to get rid of stuttering frame rate while in borderless.  There are no issues if I switch to full screen but I like multitasking with my second monitor.  Strangely enough, I swear everything was working fine before my last windows update a few days ago.

Previously, I had G-Sync set to Full Screen and Windowed, VSync on in NVCP and off in game.

I've tried setting G-Sync to Full Screen only and using nvidia inspector to Full Screen + Windowed for the specific game I'm trying to play.  I've updated graphics drivers.  I've set the scaling option to GPU on both monitors under ""Adjust desktop size and position"" in NVCP.  I've turned on the G-Sync indicator and it shows G-Sync on regardless of if I start the game up in full screen or borderless.  Changing from multi display performance to single multi display performance in nvdia inspector didn't seem to change anything at all.  I've also tried limited frame rate from 1-3 less than the refresh rate.

Still, none of these fixed the slight stuttering with borderless.  I've tried just about every combination of settings I can think of now and I'm running out of ideas.

So the later decision was to get a P4000, however the pricing was the same as the RTX 4000, which is much newer.

So my question is, what would an engineer benefit from getting a RTX Quadro (Turing Based) vs the Pascal based Quadro, since engineer doesn't need to do ray tracing renders for most their work.

I'm also considering bidding for a used P6000, if the price is less than the RTX 4000. Is this a better option than getting a new RTX 4000?

I recently picked up an MSI gaming laptop and have finally had a chance to sit with it and try to set it up how I want it to operate.

My laptop only has one HDMI port, and I want the two screens to be able to run independently. My question is, if I use one monitor's HDMI cable and plug it directly into my laptop's HDMI port, can I use a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cable and plug that into my laptop's mini displayport (while HDMI is plugged in) and have both monitors work and be able to be separate displays?

Below, you can see a benchmark average of their 12 gaming tests under every monitor resolution (without the results of synthetic tests like 3DMark). As all mobile benchmarks, they can not be perfect - but you get the rough picture.

Unfortunately, Notebookcheck only provide benchmarks against the full fat predecessor, not MaxQ vs. MaxQ. The TDP of the new MaxQ solutions limit them strongly, they not reach the performance of the old mobile solutions. But to dig deeper, it looks like we need the real TDP (power limit) value of every notebook, who is tested. Right now, we have just the ""TDP class"" of these mobile solutions, but not the (graphics) power limit for specific notebooks, set by the notebook manufacturer.

nvidia,Doodle1090,0,1,"Possible to liquid cool a Zotac 2080Ti twin fan?Hi,

 I want to liquid cool my 2080Ti Twin Fan. I have been considering a few options, namely the Kraken G12 with a CPU AIO. However, I realized that this cooling option would completely ignore a set of VRMs to the left of the chip. 

&amp;#x200B;

As such, I looked into Asetek (or another company, I cant recall right now) for a GPU Cooling solution for my card, but it seems they don't have compatibility for the Twin Fan version from Zotac and while they do offer to take your card and do a custom AIO for it, this is only for European customers.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, I looked into the EVGA hybrid kit for the 2080Ti and was wondering if it will work for my card as it seems to be the best fit so far. I cannot go down the path of custom watercooling due to space constraints but a GPU AIO seems fine. Are there any other ideas anyone has?"

However, whenever I drop a high kill game, I want to go back and record the entire game. Is there any way I could like set up some keyboard shortcut or something that would differentiate one shortcut to a 1 minute replay, and another shortcut that would save around a 20 minute replay. On El Gatos recording software, the way you record is it is always recording, and then you can drag back in time to however long ago you want to capture to, and it’ll save all that back up in time. Is there any time slider application like that at all?

With stock settings out of the box I see that MSI Afterburner flashes Power and Voltage Limits. The card boosts to 1965hz out of the box, I suspect, the limits are normal and have to do with the BIOS of the Advanced version and the power limits of that? 

When I max out power limiter with no other changes or minor adjustments to clocks, I don't get Power limit, but still get Voltage limit.

Max overclock achieved before I start having issues:

Core Frequency: +130 (125 in afterburner) (maxes to 2080hz and then drops to 2055 and remains stable) / 

Memory Frequency: + 1000 (didn't ask for more)

Voltage: Maxed out gave me a 1.5-2 fps increase in benchmarks.

(the above also hits power limit occasionally when under load) - adjusting voltage does not make a noticeable difference but 1.5-2 fps increase in benchmarks, nor voltage limit goes.

Lastly, I though that when switching between OC and Gaming modes in GPU tweak  the base clock increases by 30 to 1680. When switching to OC preset mode GPU Z suggests that base has changed but actual operating base clock at the time does not change.

I'm currently debating on whether to upgrade to the 2080 RTX TI from my 1080 GTX SLI setup. To give a little backstory, I'm an artist that works in the feature animation industry, and I'm really interested in experimenting with the real-time raytracing capabilities in unreal engine and create some of my own projects utilizing this awesome tech.  


Currently, I've been using my cards for rendering with offline render engines like Redshift, and also for occasionally gaming. Based on my research, it seems like my current GPU setup has mow raw compute power, so it wins out in situations like rendering with engines like Redshift/Octane, but the 2080 generally tends to perform better in most games, and obviously has the added perk of the real-time raytracing capabilities.

nvidia,svartchimpans,0,1,"TECHNICAL QUESTION: 2070 Super models with the highest-quality VRMs and PCBs?*I'm currently researching this, but would definitely appreciate some crowd-sourced statistics if someone else already did this research!*

There's a big difference in quality between various 3rd party graphics card vendors, and even their different models of the same GPU. For example, some of them remove vital chips and lower the quality of the few chips they keep, which in turn means that the GPU won't overclock well, and that it will die prematurely due to failing chips.

Other vendors/card models increase the quality of the chips and add even more features to the PCB to ensure long-term reliability.

In general, the higher-priced a card is, the better quality VRM and cooling system. And if it's a pre-overclocked card, it generally has a better-binned GPU chip that can handle even more overclocking easily.

With this in mind, does anyone here know which 2070 Super cards have great VRMs and cooling systems? I'm looking for something with an 8+2 phase VRM or better, and with quality components (not a bunch of premature-death ticking bomb garbage components).

My build is ~3 years old at the moment, and I'd like to get suggestions for updating my GPU. I have an ASUS STRIX ROG GTX 1050TI OC 4GB currently.

* Motherboard: ASUS Strix Z270E

Immediately after installing windows (didn't even make it to the login screen) I was bombarded by every GPU-related problem imaginable, mostly artifacts and bluescreens. 

Crashes happened while gaming, web browsing and even when idle. Sometimes the card would work great for hours, but would eventually crash the system. I tested the same card with different video cables, pci-e slots and even on an old system, which wouldn't even enable the nvidia drivers, just gave code 43 on device manager. Apparently, RTX cards had a bad rap since launch, with various theories popping up blaming faulty VRAM (this specific card has samsung VRAM), guess I should have done my homework before buying. 

This is beyond disappointing especially since this is my first gaming system in 8 years. Now because of the corona lockdown, I can't get any replacement, so I just have to suck up the fact I spent thousand of dollars for a watercooled brick.

I hope that you can help me because I'm losing my mind with this issue.

Basically I started playing COD: Warzone three weeks ago with my GTX 970, after one day or so I overclocked the GPU. The following day, I opened the game and started having the freezing issues and also a rattling noise coming from the GPU (I Though so). 

Since I was stupid in OC the GTX 070. I went to a shop to buy another GPU, this time a Geforce GTX 1660. I formatted the HD and installed all the correct drivers. Fast forward one week, I'm getting again the same issue. I can't even open the game in Low Settings, the rattling noises appears when the GPU is trying to load the frames and when the image is frozen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyone can point me what I should do? What are the odds of buying a broken GPU and get the same issue? :/ 

&amp;#x200B;

What I already did to solve but with no luck:

\- Cleaned all the components inside the case

\- I removed the CPU thermal paste and added again

\- Changed the PCI E port for the GPU

\-Uninstalled NVIDIA HD Audio Drivers

\-Set the performance of the CPU to the maximum in Power Settings

nvidia,Solar_RaVen,5,1,"Game Ready Driver vs Studio Driver. Whats the difference?I've looked through previous posts regarding this topic but none were able to properly clarify in a single post, so thank you for taking interest.

I've been playing Doom Eternal recently and have been plagued with a black-bar screen flickering when using any form of v-sync. I noticed it did not occur as much when I adjusted Texture Pool from Ultra to High, but still happens enough to be a nuisance. My guess is the flickering happens once the GPU ms gets too high. Some reading on forums presents that this is a common issue among the GTX 10 series of GPUs. The only fix that has been given is to rollback drivers to v.442, which was the version of Game Ready before Half-Life Alyx came out.

This is where Game Ready and Studio come in. The current GRD is v.445 while Studio is v.442. As I was looking for where I can rollback my driver, I noticed that G-Force Experience offers Studio Driver as an alternative to Game Ready Driver. I immediately noticed that Studio Driver happens to be version 442 which was the same version that Game Ready was prior to this last update that is causing the issue. 

So, my question and my guess is as follows: are Game Ready and Studio two totally different drivers?  Because Im guessing they are the same except Game Ready is a rapid deployment to keep up with games while Studio Driver is considered the more stable long-term release.

I'm going to install Studio Driver and test it out, if people are interested then I will post again with my results and thanks again for reading."

&gt;  
&gt;Open the game and go to Advanced Settings under Video in your Options menu.  
&gt;

nvidia,EeK09,11,1,"Has Fast Sync been stealthily updated to work with Vulkan games?Until very recently, Nvidia had a FAQ page stating that Fast Sync only worked with games running in DirectX 11 and below. 

That same page specifically said that DX12, OpenGL and Vulkan titles were *not* compatible with the technology, and that an update could come in the future to add support for those APIs (something that users have been anticipating for years).

Yesterday, I was helping a friend set up his PC for Doom Eternal, and suggested that he used Fast Sync with an fps cap, since he doesn’t have a VRR display.

However, I completely forgot that Eternal runs exclusively in Vulkan, and Fast Sync should have no effect on it. Still, he said that the “fix” helped immensely, and that he didn’t experience any stuttering, screen flashes or tearing after making the changes.

After I remembered about the Fast Sync limitations, I checked Nvidia’s [FAQ](https://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/4160/related/1) once again and, to my surprise, noticed that it had been updated on 04/12/2019 to say that Fast Sync isn’t supported for DX12 games - **with no mention of OpenGL or Vulkan**.

nvidia,perdyqueue,8,1,"ASUS European RMA process insight please. Is it worth RMAing my card?Well, I wasn't looking forward to this. My card is ASUS and I have fears about their RMA process.

For the last few months I've been dealing with crashes in PUBG and Apex Legends, and rarely on desktop. Those games are known for crashing, but that doesn't explain desktop crashes nor the fact that an underclock seems to completely eliminate crashing in both games, which crash every time at stock.

I already had some misgivings when I stability tested the card shortly after purchase and it only managed to run benchmarks without artifacts with around +25Mhz with power limit maxed, and I mean literally that's the highest I could go without immediately running into artifacts. That usually means the actual stable clock is a fair bit lower, and stability in hours of gaming is lower than that.

My card has two BIOSes, one with a higher clock speed, which was default. I'm crashing even on the lower clocked BIOS, and it runs stable when I underclock the card ~40Mhz, so if I recall correctly, that's around 70Mhz lower than the default higher clocked BIOS.

I've been trying to ignore it, but it's also disappointing that my card is unstable even at the lower of the default clocks. I can't say I'm happy that my £800 GPU is probably going blow for blow with an overclocked £500 2070S.

So - what's the ASUS Europe RMA experience, typically? Sadly I'm just 4 days out of the initial 6 month period so I have fewer protections in the EU. Am I going to pay postage and lose my card for 2 months only to receive a crusty refurb in return? Worth RMAing just for an unstable stock clock?"

The seller got the card as a gift, tried it for a day. He's got the invoice and says the card is still under warranty. In Austria, the 2070 S is listed for €539 on nvidia's website. 

I intend to build a custom loop for my system and the GPU will be water cooled too. It'll be paired with a 3700X and 32 GB of 3600 MHz memory. I plan to play around with overclocking everything.

I read that nvidia no longer bins GPUs for their FE cards, so there certainly isn't a distinct advantage over cards from other vendors. The cooling is mostly irrelevant since I'll be using a waterblock.

Waterblock compatibility is certainly a factor and the cheapest non FE card I can find that has a compatible full cover EK waterblock costs close to €550.

Does the FE have any other drawbacks compared to other cards? Is there a reason to not take this deal?"

It is still working in absolute warm temps of my region.

Went for Ryzen 3600 build and gtx 1660 Super and my Lord. The performance gains went mind blowing. 
I went from 35 fps in bfv to 140+ (low settings)
And a constant 300 fps in OW.

nvidia,EerieEgg,6,1,"DRS + DLSS in Future TitlesCurrently there are some titles on PC that support **""Dynamic Resolution Scaling""** (Titanfall 2 for example). What this does exactly is \[covered here by Digital Foundry\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS\_PhWP9YQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GS_PhWP9YQI)) where they talk about a recent mod that unlocks **DRS** from the console versions of the game on PC with some very interesting results.

One thing I'd be very curious to see is **""Dynamic Resolution Scaling""** combined with Nvidia's **""Deep Learning Super Sampling""** \-- this could be especially interesting for users who would rather vary the image resolution than the framerate/users who are targeting a specific framerate where presently DLSS only works off a static resolution that never varies with load.

So, for example, of course DOOM 2016 does not have DLSS support (though DOOM Eternal likely will), but image you as a user are attemping what Alex is attempting in that DF video linked above where you want a locked 60 fps on midrange hardware with your high resolution monitor.

DRS can get you there, but you all it does is standard/traditional upscaling -- instead, one could theoreticlly ""upgrade"" that upscaling to image reconstruction like DLSS. Would be really cool to test/see results for I think."

Well, some background.  I was using like 440.80 or something older like that.  Don't remember.  A year old.  It was fine.  But I learned about Nvidia's implementation of RTSS, and since I wanted to see if I could improve latency in an emulator, decided I need this.  So I got the latest driver.  This made my Nvidia Control Panel disappear.  Rebooting didn't help.  Lowering the driver revision (still with their RTSS) didn't help.  Apparently the only thing that would make it come back, for whatever-the-HELL reason, was to download the Nvidia Control Panel straight from Microsoft.  (***WHY!?***)  But Microsoft's ""store"" refused to let me.  Like it was broken or something.  What I ended up having to do was install the ""GeForce Experience"" which I had made a damn point of not installing in the past.  Nvidia must really want people to use that POS because this time the Nvidia Control Panel was finally back.

But, as expected, that extra fluff is causing me extra problems, starting with automatic updates and other interruptions I simply do not want.

Anyway, let's tackle the first problem first.  Auto updates.  Apparently... this has been engineered in a way that getting a solid damn answer on how to prevent it is hard.  To the point that Google is no real help and so here I am.  I don't want to ""log in"" just to even check how to disable this thing.  What I'd really love is to simply get rid of GeForce Experience, but not, you know, lose Nvidia Control Panel again in the process.

Well its not doing that lol. First and foremost, i can check gpu scaling only in global profile but not in a single game profile.  
Also in the supported resolutions, i don't have ""half"" native resolution; i had to create a custom resolution, which it works, BUT the game doesn't ""see"" it.  


So my question is, i'm doing something wrong? Shouldn't i have a GPU scaling check box in my game profile instead of enabling it globally?  
Also i'm starting to think that this ""technology"" doesn't really take in account if you're using an Ultrawide monitor?  
I've tried 1280x720 and its obviously stretched as hell, unbearable.  


Thanks in advance for the help."

nvidia,XRaVeNX,13,1,"[Guide] Fixing GSync Flickering on LG 34UC79G-B GSync Compatible MonitorI own an [LG 34UC79G-B](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34UC79G-B-ultrawide-monitor) 34"" Ultrawide 144Hz monitor. It has Freesync but is also GSync compatible.

I recently upgraded to an Nvidia RTX 2080 Super and noticed that when I enabled GSync, the monitor would randomly stutter (i.e. [blink one frame black seemingly at random](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/ag6w8j/the_flickering_freesync_monitor_lg_34uc79g_nvidia/?st=jw0cmdr9&amp;sh=32e7c190)).

Searched around on Reddit and elsewhere online and finally found a solution that works for me. YMMV, but here is a guide of what I did, so others with the same problem can try it. I am running Windows 10 x64.

To enable GSync:

1. Make sure you have the latest [Nvidia drivers](https://www.geforce.com/drivers) installed ([441.87 as of this post](https://imgur.com/tScaXR1)). If you have an older version installed, use [Display Driver Uninstaller](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) to completely uninstall it before you install a newer version. To find what version you have installed, [Right-click on Desktop&gt;NVIDIA Control Panel](https://imgur.com/3avPXXT)&gt;[Bottom Left corner ""System Information""](https://imgur.com/lXa7Ugv).
2. Make sure your monitor is connected to your computer via DisplayPort. HDMI will not work.
3. On your LG monitor, access the [menu system&gt;Picture&gt;Game Adjust&gt;FreeSync&gt;On](https://imgur.com/Eqmyv1j)
4. Go back into NVIDIA Control Panel. [Side Menu Display&gt;Set up G-SYNC should now be an option. Check ""Enable G-SYNC, G-SYNC Compatible"", select ""Enable for windowed and full screen mode"", and select ""Enable settings for the selected display model""](https://imgur.com/jDLKgdp).

G-SYNC is now enabled on your monitor and graphics card. If you want to verify that it is enabled when it is engaged, you can:

1. Go to NVIDIA Control Panel. [Side Menu Display&gt;Set up G-SYNC. Go to the Top Menu Display&gt;Check G-SYNC Compatible Indicator.](https://imgur.com/jDLKgdp) It will now show ""G-SYNC"" on the top-left side of the screen whenever G-SYNC is being used. Reverse this step after you have finished troubleshooting this issue.

To replicate the flickering issue:

1. Download and install the [Nvidia Pendulum Demo](http://www.nvidia.ca/coolstuff/demos#!/g-sync).
2. Run it and make sure G-SYNC is selected on the top left.
3. [Select ""FPS Sliders"" on the bottom left. Set the Framerate Min/Max to Min 20fps, and Max 75fps.](https://imgur.com/VSjyGSF) You should see the image randomly blink out for a frame or two, as the framerate ramps up and down.

I found with my setup, the monitor flickers at 28fps and 56fps (2x 28). I found this by setting the Min and Max to 20fps and slowly increased it, 1fps at a time. It appears this changes depending when the video card and monitor ""synced"" together. A second test I found my monitor flickers at 32fps and 64fps (2x 32). So this may change with every reboot.

To fix the flickering issue:

1. You will need to download [Custom Resolution Utility](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU). After you extract it, you will see 4 files. [CRU.exe, reset-all.exe, restart.exe, and restart64.exe](https://imgur.com/VaN6tFL).
2. Run CRU.exe. [Click ""Edit..."" at the top beside your monitor name. In the Display Properties window, for the Range limits, change the V rate to 57 - 144 Hz. Click OK.](https://imgur.com/ZNzc1xt)
3. [In the bottom section called ""Extension blocks (2 slots left)"", there should be one item ""CEA-861: etc."" Select that and click ""Edit..."" underneath.](https://imgur.com/nFfmiyb) 
4. In the Extension Block window, in the bottom half of the window is the Data blocks section. If there is an item called ""FreeSync range"", highlight it and select ""Edit..."". [If not, select ""Add..."" and add a FreeSync range.](https://imgur.com/f3J8b4G)
5. In either case, make the range 57 - 144 Hz. Click OK to all the windows to close out the CRU.
6. Run restart64.exe. Once the display drivers have restarted, run the Nvidia Pendulum Demo again to verify the fix. An easy way is to set the FPS min to 20fps and max to 144fps. If you don't see any flicker as the fps ramps up and down, you have your fix. 

Unsolved Issues:

1. I have been unable to resolve a ""ghosting"" issue. This occurs if while you are in a G-Sync enabled game/application and you turn off and on the monitor. You can replicate this by turning the monitor off while running the Nvidia Pendulum Demo and then turning the monitor back on."

NS sadly doesn't have the 144fps option from what I could tell.

So if I boot up a game, record while my screen is set at 144hz does the footage get buggy or something? Because I (me who's looking t the monitor) get to see 144fps, while NS only sees 60fps.

Sure, I can change my 144hz to 60hz, but I'd rather skip out if I can, I do like dem 144fps. 

Basically if I use a 144hz monitor, and capture 60fps footage does the footage f*ck over in some way? Or will I be fine?

Yet there has been 0 updates since Nov last year, everyone is running 425 or earlier if you're like me running a GTX745m on a laptop, and when I speak to the support team, I get interesting quotes such as "" If there is any critical update that has to be updated, then NVIDIA will release that security update"", "" It does not mean it is insecure. It does not support the latest driver updates. The security updates does not mean that your card is prone to any damage due to external sources.

Furthermore, if not for the AMP's requirement for an 8 and a 6-pin connector rather than just an 8-pin I'd just buy the EVGA. Will this tangiblyaffect how much I can OC the card or out-of-the-box boost clocks?

**Maximum Framerate**

In the last Game Ready Driver, we introduced a new Maximum Framerate Setting into the NVIDIA Control Panel which allowed gamers to set the max framerate a 3D application or game can render. With the latest Game Ready Driver, we’ve incorporated community feedback asking for the limits to be extended. As a result, framerate limits can be as low as 20fps and can be raised as high as 1000fps.

**Support For Newly Validated G-SYNC Compatible Displays**

Our newest Game Ready Driver driver adds support for three previously-announced G-SYNC Compatible displays – gaming monitors that deliver a baseline Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) experience that makes your gaming smoother, clearer, and more enjoyable.

The newly-validated monitors are the ASUS VG259QM, Dell AW2521HF, and LG 34GN850, giving gamers even more choice when searching for a great gaming display.

I reinstalled drivers and even rolled back to the previous one and nothing changed. I tried running Heaven benchmark and it crashed every time after about a minute. Some games I can't even get passed the loading screen. Please I need help. Is there anything I can do? Is it a dead card? Thank you for your time and I would appreciate any and all answers to this.
nvidia,Archimagus,0,1,"Nvidia WHY ALWAYS?Why is there seemingly no way to fix this?  No matter what order I plug in the monitors, no matter what side I drag them to, it is always wrong?  Is it too much to ask to want to have the monitor that the PC posts to, be monitor number 1?  And yes I know I can drag to swap sides, that's not the problem.

nvidia,Dreadzone03,0,1,"Asus Strix 1080 A8G Fans stay at 100% after ramping upHi all, I've been having some trouble lately with my Asus Strix 1080 A8G, once i open any graphical demanding software the fans ramp up to 100% and will stay at 100% untill the pc is turned off. while its at 100%, Msi after burner/ hwinfo/aida all show 0 fan speed and 0% fan spin. but i know its 100% based on the jet engine noise.  


I have tried installing drivers from 386.96 to latestest drivers,

tried fresh Win10 install,  
tried DDUing into safe mode,  
tried pushing the fan PWM plug tighter into the socket on the gpu PCB,  
tried uninstalling then reinstalling msi afterburner.  


nothing seems to be fixing the issue.  
things to note. this GPU was tested on multiple systems, including a i7 920/X58, i7 7700/Z270p, i7 7600/B250m, with different PSUs and bios flashing the card. nothing works.

nvidia,Cjsaw158,6,1,"2070 Super or 2080 Super for my triple screen sim racing buildSo I’m building my first “gaming PC”. It will be used for triple screen 1080p 144hz sim rig for both racing sims and flight simulator. 
The only other games I like to play are FPS.
The system is as follows....
Ryzen 3600x (got on sale for $200)
Hyper 212
B450 Tomahawk Max MOBO
16g 3600 ram (g skill)
1 tb m.2 (inland premium or something like that)

My goal is to have good refresh rates on the triples for sim stuff (90ish FPS) and some decent longevity there.
When I’m playing FPS would like to just use the middle monitor at or near 144fps.
I already own an Acer 1440p 144hz monitor that I use now on my Xbox. My options are to buy to more of those so I can run the one monitor in 1440 for FPS and general use. And then when I sim race I would use the triples but turn them down to 1080p to keep FPS and graphics settings decent. Or I could buy three separate 1080 monitors for the same relative price as the two extra 1440 monitors and have a separate “station” for the triples and the single monitor. Space is an issue so the later would be tough.
So the ultimate question is which card would be best for my needs and wants and is running my 1440 monitor in non native 1080 that big of a deal (I’ve ran the monitor in both 1440 and 1080 on my Xbox and for the life of me I can’t tell the difference). The main reasons I want to run 3 1440 monitors is the size (27” to 24” for the set of 1080 monitors), when I’m just generally using my PC or playing FPS be able to use the middle screen in native 1440, when I’m using the triples turn them down to 1080 (if there’s even a need to do that for good refresh rates and graphics).
Thanks in advance people!!

nvidia,Minoltah,9,1,"[AU] 1650S, 1660S or 3060?So, my really awful Asus 960 Strix died last year and at the moment I've only got a 760, but I'm really keen on playing Escape From Tarkov, so what do I get? My display is just 1080p with no view to move to 1440p.

Based in Australia, my options are:

- Galax GeForce GTX 1650S 4GB EX, AU$229 (MSRP$259)
- Gigabyte 1660S 6GB Gaming OC/3-fan, AU$359 (MSRP$439)
- Possible GTX 3060 pricing at around $400-450? What about performance? 

Besides Tarkov I only have some older titles like IL-2 BoS and Wargame: Red Dragon, Skyrim and Minecraft with shaders &amp; texture packs. I know Tarkov is pretty poorly optimised and my 960 could handle those older titles. 

Are the prices on these cards good, given all cards are higher because of Crypto mining etc? That market influence seems unlikely to dwindle anytime soon. 
I think the 3060/3050 won't come until Q3 or Q4 of this year, my guess is retailing at $400-450/$300-350, with probably no greater price drops on the 1660S as what I can get now? 

For reference, the AMD 5600XT 6GB just launched here for $485-569 although I understand Samsung's EUV 7nm process for Nvidia is going to ""aggressively undercut"" TSMC's pricing."

I recently overclocked my MSI GTX 1660 Armor and managed to get stable +140 on the Core, and +999 on the Memory.

So I downloaded nvflash and the latest BIOS for the Gaming X variant of my card, but always get the Error: GPU mismatch

nvidia,NewLunarKnights,0,1,"Issue with gpu hanging and crashingHi there reddit,

I have recently been very into playing Modern Warfare, and i downloaded a patch to the game a couple weeks ago. After downloading the patch, I had noticed that the game started to crash in every single match of any mode with ""Dev Error 6068. DirectX has encountered an unrecoverable issue."" I tried all of the fixes that people have tried for this issue, including lowering settings, but nothing worked (It's also a 2080 ti, so I shouldn't have to lower settings). Underclocking my card only delayed the time it would take to crash.

Thinking that it was just an issue with cod, I decided to focus on a different game while maybe waiting for an update for cod to come out that mentioned something about fixing crashes. I decided to get back into overwatch, not a very demanding game at all. However, when I now start a match in overwatch, I will guaranteed crash in every single match, no matter settings, with an error that says: ""Rendering device has been lost! Application closing!""

I thought it was just a game isolated issue, but it now seems to be happening in every single game that I try to play. Benchmarks like UNIGINE Heaven run completely fine for hours, with only minor stutters here and there. I'm currently trying to talk with ASUS support (Nvidia support told me to just go to them). I really hope my card isn't becoming faulty. Anyone have any idea what might be going wrong here?

All of my drivers and whatnot are up to date. No corruption on drives or defragging needed. Memory tests come up clear. At a loss. BONUS: on top of this, every now and then my Windows boot seems to just corrupt... out of nowhere. I don't do anything on my desktop other than game and watch youtube. I will just go to restart on a random day and Windows will decide that it is just never going to boot, looping endlessly and leading me to revert to a backup or do a clean install. Last time happened about a month ago. I'm only mentioning this issue in the case that it could in some way be related to my gpu issue.

I have an InWin 303 with 3 intake fans at the bottom with the other 4 exhausting. I know this case is designed for a radiator so I was wondering if putting an AIO on my CPU could help in some manner? When I take the side panel off the temperatures drop a couple degrees but remain in the high 70's. I have yet to remove the heatsink and check the thermal compound as I am unsure of any impact this may have on the warranty.

Does this look like typical performance? Any recommendations? Please ignore my janky CPU heatsink fans lol

I bought one of those silent cases with sound dampening materials on the side panels, a huge 240mm front fan and ran everything slightly undervolted with fan speeds just below audible levels. 

The PC ran a hot but not to damaging levels. It was a mini space heater in the winter :)

Now I’m on my second gaming PC and I went in a completely direction. Tempered glass side panel. RGB all over. Fan aesthetics over fan noise levels and AIOs for CPU and GPU. 

As a result my PC isn’t exactly silent even if I dial all fan speeds down a bit but I can get it pretty close. 

My CPU hovers in the high 40s low 50s and under heavy load my GPU (2080 ti) is around 70-74c if I try to run a quiet profile. 

However, if I put my GPU AIO fans to 100% I can drop the temps 10c! At the expense of a loud ass PC. 

So it led me to think, what would reddit do? 

TLDR: Quiet PC at the Expense of Temps or Lowest  possible temps at the expense of silence?"

nvidia,RavenCarci,2,1,"buying new 2070 super w/ AIO vs used 2080I recently started building a new PC, and the used 2080 I initially bought for it stopped working after a few days use in my old system. I finished the return today (Amazon) and I'm now thinking of a replacement. I did a little research and I'm currently considering two (broad) options.

The first option I'm considering is ordering another refurbished 2080. I'd get it from a different seller and hopefully avoid a similar situation. There's a few used cards/sellers that are in my price range and some of the sellers seem reputable. I'm sure I was just unlucky this time around, but I'd prefer not ending up in an infinite loop of broken cards and returns.

The second option I'm considering is a new 2070 super, with a built in AIO, like this one:  [https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Hybrid-WATERCOOLED-08G-P4-3178-KR/dp/B07XWF3JXD](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Hybrid-WATERCOOLED-08G-P4-3178-KR/dp/B07XWF3JXD)I'm thinking that the AIO will let me overclock it (or it's factory overclocked) to make up for most of the small performance difference between the 2070 super and 2080. Am I right? If I am, would it still be worth it to take the risk and buy a used/refurb 2080 over the 2070 super?

As some additional info, I'll primarily use this rig for gaming in 4k, but I might do some streaming maybe once a month. This rig will also be moved pretty frequently, on the order of a few flights a year. It will be packed *very* well for these trips.

TL;DR: Can an AIO cooled 2070 super be overclocked to compete with a normal 2080, or should I risk buying a used 2080 for a similar price?"

Just to give you, in case you don't know what issue I'm talking about, a little scenario: If I played games on my 144hz monitor while also having let's say a twitch stream open on the 60hz monitor, one of two things would happen, either:

a) I have my game in borderless / windowed mode and the fps would feel like it's 60 or

b) my game is in fullscreen, the game runs fine with max fps however the twitch video starts to stutter randomly, skipping multiple seconds sometimes.

I have an old PC which I really like (because it's been very stable for years). After going through some basic guides, I tried my hand at a light OC on my GPU.

System specs are:

CPU: AMD A6-3650 (4c, 2.6GHz)

RAM: 8Gb of DDR3 1600MHz

GPU: Geforce GTS 450 (I know, old card)

I was able to go from 822MHz at 1.0V to 925MHz at 1.150V. I got that voltage number from a previous post by somebody who had also OC'd the same card. I did all of this using the latest version of MSI Afterburner

Everything seemed fine, but after about 10-20 min, I started seeing small green and purple squares on my monitor, which increased till my Nvidia driver crashed (it consistently recovers immediately though). I should mention that I didn't overclock the memory. What might be going on? Would appreciate any advice or feedback.

So I have roughly 500 dollars to spend on a new GPU (or other components if I'm missing something and my GPU isn't what needs an upgrade the most). I've been eyeing the RTX 2070 super but I'm afraid it may be too good for my CPU.

Brand new to the Forum as I've lost the will to live with my LGC9 tv and no one at tech support or av forums seems to be able to help.

So I bought a new LG c9 tv two weeks ago model OLED65C9MLB and got the latest drivers for the g-sync option via usb from lg and it all started off well I had the option in control panel as well as showing the tv as gsync Compatible.

I selected g-sync and Enabled the TV new monitor options the option for ultra hd deep mode came up and I selected yes after which the screen become very unstable and unusable I had to plug into another HDMI to get the screen back, but now the g-sync option has gone ? I have tried removing and installing all Nvidia drivers also restoring the TV to factory settings.

I have a rtx 2080ti and I am using HDMI 20.b per Nvidia’s website instructions on setting this up. Seems crazy that it was working and now it isn’t working. Three different support people Nvidia cannot figure it out and I’m just about ready to return the TV.

Now when I select ultra hd mode the tv goes black and I have to turn it off again to get the picture back. am I missing something ? I have tried all colour modes and resolutions on the Nvidia control panel and windows.

Im sure im just missing something small here"

nvidia,kladmajster,11,1,"Alternative Freesync (G-sync compatible) settings - using fast syncHello there,  
I would like to ask, if anyone can help me with explaining if configuring my setup like this:   
Freesync (gsync comp) ON + RTSS limit 141hz (out of 144hz) + FAST SYNC   
Is it gonna pose some bad factors, artefacts or it wont work the same way as with Vsync ?

I know, that the general consensus for optimal experience, is to use: Gsync ON + RTSS -3fps + Vsync ON

This should be applicable for a freesync -gcomp monitors as well.

However, in my case, this setting introduced a very severe cases of stuttering. Like as if in any frametime spike appearing was amplified way more, instead of being nullified. Such spike also causing visible flicker due to it and generally screwing my game experience, whenever my system was unable to keep up stable fps in demanding game or a game engine was introducing typical frametime spikes due to loading/streaming/saving data etc.  
But turning off Vsync and using Fast Sync in NVCP instead, the experience is much much better.

I am curious, if actually using Fast Sync as an alternative is doing the same what Vsync would do - eliminating a possible low screen tearing, due to uneven frametime within the VRR range,   
or I would be better off without it, just in case it can cause other issues and stick to only Adaptive RR + RTSS -3fps ???

NVIDIA's position is that the code is now expired and they can't do anything about it, not even offer a code for whatever current deal they've got going as recompense.

OR just get a better graphics card for 4KHi there, been looking at the market and I would say I have 2 choices I can make for the long term. I currently game on an old 60hz TN 1080p panel from 2013, and have a 1080 Ti so I have hardware that's too good for the existing monitor. I want an upgrade in visuals, don't really care about framerate above 60 so I want to go with a 4k monitor. I decided to put an order on a £200 Freesync 4K IPS LG monitor, quite cheap but seems to be good from what I've read, and by the end of winter if I go with this monitor I intend to upgrade to an RTX 2080 Ti. Alternatively, I could go all out and get a really good 4k GSYNC monitor, maybe like a Predator XB271 OR XB281HK or one of those variants. I've read that GSYNC is really smooth and helps games look better when they drop to 50-40 fps which is going to happen on 4k on demanding titles. The problem is, GSYNC monitors are really expensive in the UK especially 4k ones, they are like £500-700 or more and that's a massive price increase just for GSYNC tech. If a monitor is Freesync and would allow some level of GSYNC compatibility, in that I get to use some adaptive sync on the monitor without a GSYNC module, shouldn't I just go for that? I understand there could be issues with slight tearing or flickering, but I've read I could turn the refresh rate down in a certain region. I don't know too much about GSYNC or even adaptive sync but I know that it's supposed to be a lot better than vsync or no sync, and I find it very noticeable when I play a game and it drops to 40 or below without any sync."

When it comes to playing games, I personally don't really prioritize maximum frame rates over visuals, as long as it's 60 or over I'm super happy, I'd rather turn my graphics all the way up and play at 60-70 FPS with G-Sync than I would turning things down to hit a pegged 144 FPS.

G-Sync has been a godsend for this, my games are running anywhere between 60-144 FPS and it feels really really good. The issue I'm running into is when games don't support Exclusive Fullscreen, this is because G-Sync will sometimes flash in Windowed mode, it's not horrible but it's enough to notice and bother me.

When these situations arise I try and turn G-Sync off for that game via the NVCP and turn V-Sync on, but even at 60 FPS it does not feel smooth as I'm still at a 144hz refresh rate. If I wanted to go for ""maximum smoothness"" is it best to turn my display down to 60hz for those games and run with vsync on using a refresh rate that I don't fall under?

Maybe I'm spoiled by G-Sync and VRR in general, but whenever I can't use G-Sync and fall back on traditional Vsync it just feels awful, but I'm assuming this is again because I'm falling under my 144 refresh rate.

Is there an alternative to switching back down to 60hz (Because I know I will rarely fall under that) and using Vsync or is this the best method to make sure things feel good when I can't use G-Sync?

Is Windowed Mode flickering with G-Sync a common issue?

Thanks everyone who takes the time to read this and help me out."

nvidia,SlyGuyontheFly,16,1,"Understanding 2080ti pricingSo I'm looking to upgrade from my gtx 980 and have spent the last couple weeks doing due diligence on what I might buy as a replacement. I've settled on the 2080, but am still exploring the SUPER vs ti. Everywhere I turn there is at least three people talking about how the price jump to the ti (vs standard and SUPER) is ""unjustified"" while providing no explanation for their conclusion other than ""it's expensive"" or pointing to pricing comparisons from previous generations (980 vs 980ti, 1080 vs 1080ti, etc.). What I'm interested in is understanding how much of the price of these cards is related to their component differences so I can make my own conclusion. For reference I'm going to be comparing the EVGA 2080 Super and the EVGA 2080 ti Black editions. I'm not thrilled about using a board partner for the analysis but the nVidia manufactured cards are sold out and from what I can tell they will be for god only knows how long. Plus I've been using EVGA cards forever =) 

2080 Super: $710   
2080 ti: $1100  
A 55% increase in price.

This price difference comes with more cores (4352 vs 3072) at a lower clock speed (1545MHz vs 1815MHz) and more ram (11GB vs 8 GB) with a larger interface (352 bit vs 256 bit) at a lower clock speed (14GHz vs 15.5GHz). All of this doesn't translate to a 55% increase in benchmark scores or fps in AAA titles which is what is sounds like everyone is upset about (I'm going to assign this assumption to them solely because they haven't provided one of their own and that bothers me).

All of the above is preamble to my questions: 

What and how much of those hardware differences influence the performance of a graphics card?   
Are those components expensive/What of the components on a graphics card are the most expensive?   
Are the AAA titles of today really taxing enough to differentiate the performance of these cards?   
Will the next generation of games be able to set these games apart with things like higher resolution textures and more fully implemented ray-tracing?   
What is the relationship between hardware and a metric like fps; is it linear or are there diminishing returns?   
How do you fight the cravings associated with PC building and is there a cure?   
Why is buying components so frustrating?

My field isn't computer hardware, so when answering these questions I don't need or want a dissertation that I need to go back to university and get a new degree to understand. That said, I'm interested in more than a r/ELI5 answer. I don't care if your CV is ""hobbyist,"" but I do want sources or at least a detailed explanation; I don't just want to get the right card, I want to understand my options and learn so I can do it again =)

nvidia,dext3rrr,0,1,"Gigabyte RTX 2060 Gaming OC fan vibrations/rattlingHi. I bought a RTX 2060 on black friday deal. Yesterday it came and I was playing Modern Warfare, when my girlfriend asked me what is that annoying vibrating (pulse like) noise. I didn’t notice it before because I was wearing headphones. I checked and that was coming from the fans. On MSI Afterburner I checked that they have settled at 83%. Vibrations then turned into even more annoying rattling. I tried to set different fan speed and it’s worst between 80-84% RPM. I then changed the fan curve for these values:

0-40 C - 0% RPM
40-50 C - 40% RPM
50-65 C - 75% RPM
65-80 C - 95% RPM
80+ C - 95-100%RPM

These settings seems to be the best.  I didn’t notice any vibrations or rattling noise with it. It’s not linear, so I don’t get to hear it comming near 80-94%. 

Can my card run on 95%+ RPM for most time? It’s not super loud even on 100%, so it’s not an issue. 

I’ve searched the internet and this seems to be a common problem with these cards and Gigabyte not always replace the card because it seems normal to them(?!). I bought  RTX for 280$, which is 100$ less than standard price in my country, so I can live with manual fan curve, not big deal. Still, switching from GTX 1060 Asus ROG Strix, in case of build quality it’s noticeable step backwards. Performance wise it’s almost 100% gain.

I've had this problem for a while and I am at a loss as to how I might be able to fix it. As the title says. My laptop has a GTX 1660, which I am completely unable to use due to this issue. I've tried to install various nvidia-driver-xxx versions through the terminal, tried to install via .run files directly from the nVidia site, and used software &amp; updates to switch drivers in the ""additional drivers"" tab.

I'm using the open source xserver-xorg-video-nouveau driver at the moment, and while that runs daily tasks smoothly I cannot take advantage of GPU acceleration when working on deep learning models and whatnot, I also can't play any games which is unfortunate.

To go over some symptoms: basically I'll install the nVidia driver through some method (the result is always the same), check to ensure that it's being used with lshw -c video, and everything will be fine for a while. After about 10-15 minutes however my computer becomes incredibly slow and unusable. Oddly enough, the fan also won't turn on when using nVidia drivers. It also seems as though the whole computer is being effected rather than just the graphics, since some of the python programs that I work on daily will take significantly longer to run when using an nvidia driver.

I searched on forums online and some laptop users also experience this but I wasn't able to find any solution on the issue. This only happens on Dying Light.

Taking my chance here, any help will be appreciated."

nvidia,juulu,4,2,"New GPU for Redshift rendering in C4D. GTX? RTX?? Advice Please.Hi there,

I'm a novice in the world of GPUs, so bear with me. 

I'm looking to buy a new GPU. I currently have a Zotac 1060 mini 6GB which has served its purpose fine so far.

I use my machine solely as a dedicated workstation for 3D animation and after effects work. 

I have now started using Redshift in Cinema 4D for my rendering, as it uses the GPU instead of the CPU, and it has massively improved the development process of my work. 

I realise my 1060 isn't the greatest, it's what my budget would allow at the time, but now I have some additional funds and would like to upgrade / add an additional GPU to my machine, solely for rendering. 

BUDGET is ~500€.

I have a few questions. 

1. Is it worth buying a newer RTX card rather than an older, cheaper GTX card? Considering my budget and sole purpose for rendering. (For example: RTX 2060Super vs GTX 1070)

2. Am I likely to face any compatibility issues with my current GPU if I run them together? The newer card will be solely for rendering, and I will only utilise the older card for rendering if and when required, though most big jobs are sent out to external render farms.

3. Considering my current GPU, what would be a sensible upgrade? Will my budget allow for a worthwile upgrade or will the gain not be worth the investment, for what I can afford. 

I was looking specifically at an EVGA RTX 2060 Super, but maybe it would make more sense to adjust my budget to accomodate a more sensible purchase if required. 

As this is a work machine, I'm not fussy over aesthetics, RGB lighting or other frills, it just has to get the work done. 

I appreciate if anyone can give me some guidance, and a steer in the right direction, and I'm happy to provide further details if required!

Thanks!

nvidia,billyhenderson82,1,1,"Crash upon launch of any game after driver updateSpecs: Zotac GTX 760 2GB, Intel I5-4570 on Windows 8.1. Please do not bully me about my computer, it is perfect and I like it until now. I have been playing a bit of GTAV in the past few weeks, and it has been running pretty fine as always. Never had any problems and I can keep pretty good settings. However, yesterday, upon finishing a doomsday heist with my friends, I had a strange crash where the computer froze when loading back into a normal online session and my computer took unusually long to restart after. I then decided to download the newest gameready driver to see if it would solve anything. But I think I ended up bluescreening when I tried loading into an online session. I had never bluescreen until that time on this computer. When I tried to turn it back on it took a sort of long time. I decided to quit after that restart and as i was about to click shut down, my pc froze and crashed, auto-restarted. This time, only my second monitor (i think its detected as the main one) turned on, the resolution super low, and red artifacty glitchy type patterns all over the screen. I gave up then. Today I turned it on and everything seemed fine on the desktop. I played a couple counter-strikes with my  buddies, and then after launching gtav, I tried to join my friend, and crashed in the loading screen to online. My entire pc crashed and took a hwile to turn on. I then tried uninstalling my gpu driver and installed older versions, nothing worked. It actually got worse with more tries. Lots of bluescreens, crashes that took forever to restart after, but also LOTS of freezing, after which a message pops up in the bottom-right saying ""display driver stopped responding and has recovered. This would begin to happen after i opened any program usually. LAunching any game would give a bunch of artifacts shortly after loading and cause a crash, occasionally only to desktop. I eventually uninstalled all of the drivers i had. cleared as many nvidia files from my computer as i could. Reinstalled geforce experience, downloaded the current drivers, restarted. Now I can use my desktop and firefox and things like that fine. But still shortly after launching any game i have a bucnh of visual artifacts and then i crash. I fear i have ruined my gpu somehow. is that even possible to do jsut with drivers/crashes. I know the current nvidia gamreadyt causes problems with gtav which I accept but I can no longer play any game. I am not sure what to do."

So I'm going to get a new GPU but not quite sure which one to get. I play newer and older titles and I want to play at 4k 60fps. I dont mind using the lowest setting possible, I just want that crisp 4k look. I won't be able to spot the details in fast paced games either.

To add there is like 1.7x difference between TI and normal here. Can I be able to do these?

Why I am asking is all the benchmarks are done in Ultra and in some newer titles non TI version cant get 60fps at 4k. As I said before I can play in the lowest quality.

Picture this:

* Every single game you have installed shows up in Experience with game settings available to tweak and customize saving people time from doing so manually
* Savable custom settings/tweak presets
* A second page/tab that allows for searching games in a community database and viewing their available tweaks

I'm wondering if there is something wrong with my card or if it is just very powerful and gets hot. It also gets up to the 84 degree limit in games that I believe is the stock limit, my GTX 1070 got there as well but I would have figured that since this is a aftermarket cooler it would have much better performance. I looked at the card and everything seemed fine, sometimes one of the fans while I was gaming would spin down and then up where as the other one was at a constant, idk if this could be leading to the issue as well.

nvidia,JewUnit1,4,1,"Can't seem to find a decent benchmark.Hey everybody, hope all is well. I ordered a 2080 TI recently, but it is backordered, so I won't have it for a while.

nvidia,vv1n,1,2,"High GPU usage in CSGO, RTX 2080, 98% all low.Recently I upgraded to an MSI rtx 2080 ventus OC from an Zotac RTX 2060. I experienced heavy FPS drops in Apex during the initial drop. I blamed season 3 update. But later when I played CSGO I noticed GPU is being heavily utilized ( about 98 % ). This is pretty weird considering my rtx 2060 never went above 40%. 

A quick search on the web suggest removing windows update, or a presence of crypto virus. I uninstalled all recent updates, played around with different Nvidia drivers but the results were the same. I also installed many Antivirus but it did not detect anything. Reinstalled windows but the issue persisted.

I installed cinebench and noticed my open gl scores lower than my previous runs ( I had archived scored from my much older gtx 1060 which surpassed rtx 2080 )

I was almost convinced that my GPU is faulty and was ready to return it. It had almost been a week and return window was closing in.

I installed MSI afterburner and under clocked the GPU. I lowered Core and memory clock to -500mhz and found performance improving slightly. Then it clicked that PSU could be at fault. I owned a Corsair VS 650.

I searched online to see if a bad PSU can cause performance issues on GPU however there was a lot of misleading information. Many people believe that poor quality PSU will only cause restarts or freezes but not performance impact.

Since my return window was closing in it took the Gamble and purchased a coolermaster v1000 locally and volia in Apex my fps increased from 60 fps to 144 fps. Also CSGO gpu utilization never went above 30%.

Lesson learnt, stay away from entry level PSU for a high end GPU. 

I hope this helps anyone facing similar issue."

There's not really a good reason for Nvidia to release a new architecture. What value does a new GPU line add compared to the previous version? A new displayport revision so that we can do 4k@144 without chroma subsampling? Nope. Higher memory bandwidth? nope, I haven't heard anything about GDDR7 coming out anytime soon. Will it increase market share for Nvidia? Not really. if Nvidia wanted to increase its market share it'd flesh out its mid-tier line of GPUs cause that's where all of AMD's cards sit. AMD doesn't have anything that can compete with Nvidia's top-end right now. And besides Nvidia only releases new GPU architectures every 2 years so this is waaay too early."

nvidia,hydra877,0,1,"DSR and all custom resolutions have completely stopped working properly since I installed 436.02. Changing drivers and even OS did not fix itI have a Zotac GTX 950 Amp! that's about 3 years old. Always used a custom resolution on my 768p monitor to bring it to 1080p, ran this for all that time without any issues whatsoever. Games ran fine, crashes only happened once in a blue moon.

The shitshow started after I installed 436.02. I started getting constant crashes on Fortnite and Apex, had to revert.

Only that reverting didn't fix it. I went through 6 different drivers and 4 different windows installations (currently on Windows 8.1). The crashes haven't stopped, it's as if the driver corrupted my GPU. Every crash is the same: the screen goes black while I can still hear the game, the TDR delay passes and the entire computer restarts. Every time, without fail. There isn't any error log being made by Windows. I went through drivers 416 to 436.15, Windows 10 1803 and 1903, and a clean install of Windows 8.1, where I wiped the entire system partition. None of those have stopped the crashes. Even in the default resolution crashes occur frequently enough to piss me off.

This wasn't a constantly occuring thing, only certain things had it happening to them and on top of that they weren't there all the time. After i noticed this happening the first time my game crashed, just a normal crash due to the game. After relaunching I didn't have the issues on the objects I had them on before anymore. After 10-15 mins of playing they reappeared though. This all culminated in a cutscene that happened a while later where a good 50% of things on screen had issues with them.

Is this an idication of my card dying? I was skeptical of getting RTX due to the countless issues I had read up on and was extremely paranoid for a good while. That said, this is the only game where it has happened to this level. The temps were only 45c, and my oc wasn't very high, I even lowered it when I first noticed.

I am new to the whole gaming PC and overclocking community so I'm just looking for answers. I built a pc for the first time (specs below). I looked into overclocking but I'm not going overly crazy with it. I ran with no problems with games nor did I run into any issues overclocking my CPU to 3.95ghz at 1.285v, but since I've upgraded my gpu to the rtx 2060 (knowing it's a completely different gpu), I'm running into all sorts of issues including very low fps. Running borderlands 2 (very aware it's an old game), with my rx590 (not overclocked) and my CPU overclocked to 3.95ghz at 1.28v, I was getting consistent 115-140fps meanwhile with my rtx2060 (not overclocked) with my CPU overclocked the same, it's all over the place dropping to as low as 45fps.

With another test, I tried to overclock my CPU to 4.0ghz at 1.356v which according, to others, should work fine, worked with my rx590 setup, but not with the 2060 setup. I also tried to slightly overclock the gpu with afterburner and my game (borderlands 2) crashed instantly.

I completely wiped my gpu driver and reinstalled them using the ddu program to see if that would help. I don't think it did.

I'm aware of the issues with borderlands 2 with physx and I haven't had a chance to fiddle around with those settings to see if that'll help.

If anyone has any insight that would help me that'd be great.

https://i.redd.it/2sq0o135w3l31.png

I'm not sure if the picture will do justice but while I'm re watching Jensen's presentation regarding DLSS, I've noticed somethings that is happening today. 

As we know, DLSS reconstruct an image using Deep Learning from a lower resolution image. I noticed that the DLSS picture has already blurry image compared to the 4kTAA (on the red circle) while having better aliasing than the 4kTAA (orange circle).

I'm somewhat critical about this technology when I'm trying it because I can see that the images are blurry. But, I can also see that DLSS generated images has also better aliasing. Tried it already with BFV and Metro Exodus using my lil bro 2080. 

But, something is different with the recently released Control, I've watched several clips in youtube including DF etc etc just to nitpick something and I'm noticing nothing difference compared to the native resolution. I even watched this clip [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBYKDQ2ms-E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBYKDQ2ms-E) and I am even fooled which one is native and with DLSS.

I'm not sure if Nvidia has done something different with the DLSS in control but I think they are improving on this side. Hope Nvidia is still improving this one out because I can see the potential of this technology but today it is becoming a meme thanks to videos like this by the Hardware Unboxed whom I'm not sure if they really understood the technology.

Let me cut to the chase: I upgraded the Quadro P3200 in my Dell Precision notebook to the Quadro RTX 3000. 

I was expecting the number of cores to be [2304](https://i.imgur.com/1f3t5ST.png) based on [NVIDIA's specifications](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/documents/quadro-mobile-line-card-n18-11x8.5-r4-hr.pdf), and hence expected performance to be roughly around that of the desktop RTX 2060 (given the 80 W power limit and 192-bit bus), but it turns out that Dell has reduced the number of cores to 1920, based on what I see in [GPU-Z](https://i.imgur.com/i21y9uR.png) and [NVIDIA's own driver](https://i.imgur.com/rwb0S37.png). 

Is this legit? I've asked Dell why this has happened (haven't received a reply yet), and I'm not sure how this is possible, when NVIDIA's own advertising material claims 2304 cores (even for the Max-Q version). 

I've *never* seen OEMs reducing the number of CUDA cores (NVIDIA itself, maybe, see 3 GB GTX 1060). 

What do? I feel rather shortchanged, as my performance boost from the Quadro P3200 is hardly 30%."

At first I thought it comes from freesync implantation. Then I did some benchmark with msi afterburner, capped fps to much lower(like 70ish), I knew that it's the frame limit problem.

I get 110-141 fps range with 141FPS limits. And fps changes very fast(0.1secs?) then I expected. GPU and CPU usage is about 20~40%. And I use i7-6700 and GTX1060 6GB.

I use a Quadro M2000 at work for AutoCAD Civil 3D. I've been getting a lot of freezing with the program lately and have been trying to determine the issue.

I monitored the performance this afternoon with GPU-Z and found it was often hitting the PerfCap with the reason ""Vrel"". However

* the GPU Load graph was quite low, rarely going over 50%.
* The core clock hits 1215MHz when it reaches the PerfCap. The boost clock value in GPU-Z is 1163.
* The GPU memory clock hits its boost limit of 1652MHz when the cap PerfCap is active

But......

* GPU Memory used does not come close to the 4GB limit (sits at around 3GB)
* Power consumption is relatively low
* GPU load stays quite low

Is this GPU not up to the task, given its clock speeds are maxing out and hitting the PerfCap, or is there something else going on?

\- Plugged in 1660TI when doing some testing on the cooling loop before loading the 2080ti back in

\- Had NVidia Inspector installed with the monitor power saver feature enabled (Disabled it already, also enabled then disabled it again to be sure)

\- Had MSI afterburner (uninstalled)

\- Had CPU-Z (Uninstalled)

\- Had E-Leet X (uninstalled)

\- Had MSI live update (never worked, uninstalled)

\- Had GPU-Z (Uninstalled)

have changed the settings in the nvidia control panel to prefer performance

nvidia,fttklr,7,1,"Updating the laptop: either via external GPU box or via game streamingHi guys,

My laptop start to show its age; so I was planning to upgrade it, although I do not have a large budget, so a new system is not an option. I was thinking to get an external GPU box, which cost in the 200-300 dollars range; and couple it with a brand new card, like a 2060 or 2070. That would cost me less than buying a brand new system, since I can just use the existing CPU, motherboard, storage and RAM.

Although I was told that even with latest Thunderbolt, the performances on external cards are not that great. I have no reference for that; except some videos that I saw online, but they use 2080TI , not mid range cards.

Another option is streaming; since I can get my existing 6th gen desktop PC without a video card (using it for office work in the living room; works great with Intel integrated GPU), so I could spend a bit more and get a 2070 and more RAM maybe, and transform the living room pc in a streaming station, streaming games from that computer to my laptop.

But even for this solution, I have no data to figure out if it will work for me. People complain about streaming games; some videos on youtube show streaming with a 2080ti for games like assassin's creed origins at highest settings in 1080p, end up being very slow. If with a 1K card, streaming is below 60 FPS on 1080p; at that point I play on my current laptop.

What would you suggest as option? The external GPU or a reliable streaming approach? I can't remove the desktop pc from the living room, and swap it with the laptop, so it is either the external gpu or the streaming approach (or if I win the lottery this weekend, I get a brand new computer :P).

I now have a 2080 for my rig and general consensus is downvolting is the play? I’m going to hit some high points and see if I have this right....

1. Open up MSI AB, don’t mess with any temp/power limit settings, and run OC scan.
2. With now acquired VF curve from OC scan, open and run benchmark (Superposition??).
3. Find point in MSI AB trends where throttle happened.
4. Select this point in the MSI AB VF curve and flatten everything past it.
5. Run more benches/play to ensure everything is stable and possibly try to eek better performance from the undervolt in the future.

Is this correct?? Also I guess one of my biggest questions is where does fan curve come into play? I should make a point that my 2080 is the MSI Aero blower model, so as it stands with currently using the OC that OC scanner provided for me with max temp/power limit, to keep my card sub 80 degrees, the fan is running at 90%. After the undervolt of my preference is found, can I then add a custom fan curve to it or does this need to be done before I even run the first OC scan?

&amp;#x200B;

This process is extremely simple, what you have to do is download the driver you want to install, use winrar or 7-zip to extract it to a folder then go to device manager, click on display adapters, right click on your GPU(display adapter), select update driver and then click ""browse my computer for driver software"". Then click on ""let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer"" and after that click on ""have disk..."". Using the browse option select the folder ""Display.Driver"" that is inside the folder where you extracted everything and just click on ok, windows will pick the correct driver by itself. A new driver will show up(probably without a name, just the gpu name) in the update drivers window, you just need to click on OK as the final step and windows will take care of the rest.

I am currently building my first PC, and am heavily in doubt if I should get an RTX 2070 super or RTX 2080 super.

Does anyone have an idea when we can expect the 2080 reviews? 

I have heared mixed reports, some saying that the 2080 super will be barely any better than a 2080 which would make the 2070 Super the better choice. Some other people suspect that it will be only a few % worse than the TI, which would make the 2080 super the better choice...

I'm mainly worried because with the 2070 super releasing tomorrow, waiting till the 2080 super releases for reviews may make me miss out on stock if I decide to go for the 2070 anyways...

I uninstalled my previous AMD drivers, downloaded the installer for nvidia drivers, installed the card, and the first issue I noticed was my PC would turn on, and then turn off, repeat. It’d stay on for like 5-7 seconds, and then turn on after 2-3 seconds after turning off. I fasten the 8-pin PSU cable even though it was pretty much already fastened, eventually it stayed on, I got into Windows, and installed the drivers. Everything was fine, until I loaded up a game and I got the classic blue screen of death. The stopcode was “SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION”. I turned off my PC cause it wouldn’t reboot, and then I turned it on, and this time I got the blue screen of death right away, same stopcode. After another reboot, went back to turn on and off like before. Anyone know the solution for this? Hoping the card isn’t faulty. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

November 2018 I bought my Gigabyte RTX 2070 Windforce. I worked just fine until June 11th. When it broke down. Glitches, space invaders and the works. 

Sent it away for RMA via the retailer where I bought it from the 12th. Went away for about three weeks, and it came back this Saturday. I was kinda hoping they would give me a brand new card, maybe a Windforce rev 2.0. but it was the same card, with the micron chip (or chips) replaced by new ones. (This according to a note that came with the package).

Now I've heard some speculation at the time claiming most of the failures came from these micron chips in 2070's and 2080's. I also remember reading somewhere on the Nvidia forums that this wasn't the case, and Samsung chips where failing just as much. 

In all honesty, I'm feeling kinda morose about owning this 2070 Windforce. Like I'm waiting for it to fail again. Last thing I want is to be stuck with a dead €530 brick if it decides to fail after the warranty runs out. 

Obviously the launch of these cards came with some controversy. People thinking they are overpriced, and RTX being not ready yet yadayada. I'm not sure of the failure rates of these cards are blown out of proportion because of that. (People just wanting more reasons to hate on these cards). But here I am. 

My point/question being: Am I overreacting? Am I just seeing the negatives? Are there people here who had a 2070/2080 sent in for repairs and it worked out just fine? Should I try and push for a replacement/refund at the retailer? 

 Love to hear y'all perspectives.

So what I ultimately want to have by April of next year (Cyberpunk 2077) is a 3440x1440p monitor and a set up that will last me at that resolution for at least 2-3 years. 

I was initially going to upgrade to Ryzen 3700x right about now as my motherboard can just slot the chip in. Then I was going to wait to see if I can get a new monitor around Black Friday. In order to make sure I had longevity on the GPU front with that resolution, I was eyeing a 2080 super or 2080ti just before Cyberpunk. The issue I think with this method is that I feel like next year GPU's are going to make a much more massive increase for performance so upgrading to near TI 2080 ti would price wise be not worth it. Money matters but in the end I can stretch to get what I want. 

&amp;#x200B;

But now I am thinking of perhaps foregoing the Ryzen 3700x for now and putting that down for a 2070 super. Enjoying an fps boost on my current monitor if no bottleneck with the 1600 and then getting a monitor black friday. the 2070 super should be able to hold on to 60 fps at 3440x1440p for Cyberpunk I hope. At that point, is there any reason to get a Ryzen 3700x? Spending less today on a GPU may allow me to upgrade late 2020 early 2021 I would assume, especially if I forego a new processor. I stream every once in a while but otherwise just mostly game.

So I had my eyes on the 5700xt or one of the super cards (I guess the 5700xt competitor was the 2070s correct?). 

So my goal is to be able to play games like cyberpunk2077 and the upcoming CoD with 144hz if thats even possible with my budget. 
Both games that have Ray tracing available but I kinda lack the knowledge about Ray tracing since I fear I won't have my desired frame rate if I have rtx enabled ( no clue if there even is a noticeable drop in frames)

My cpu is also fairly old since its a i5 6600k if I remember correctly, do I have to upgrade that as well? 


sorry if things are hard to understand since I'm just throwing out my thoughts right now but I'm really inexperienced in pc stuff like that and could use some help there


Not sure if it matters but I'm currently using this monitor: Asus vg248qe with 144hz on most games with 1080p

I told him that its gsync compatible and he didnt belive me. So i am asking u guys will i be able to play on more than 60 hz? Or do i need gsync to play on more.

I have heard that u can somehow adjust it in ur windows settings but i dont know how?
Also is aw2518hf gsync compatible and will i be able to hit 240 hz with gsync (will lock fps).
Are u able to play on more than 60 hz without gsync and if yes how? 

TL;DR- will my monitor be locked at 60 hz  with an nvidia gpu (rtx 2060)  because it doesnt have gsync but is gsync compatible (not officialy)

Just explain to me if gsync has any affect on how much hz will monitor have (with or without gsync)

Tnx"

Adjusted Disk Cache Time to 15,000 ms

**Nvidia Control Panel Settings** 

a.) Refresh Rate - Adjusted Display Refresh Rate to match Source content @ 24p = **3840x2160x 24Hz**, when I adjusted this to 30 Hz I noticed significant Judder/jerkiness. At 60 Hz+ the ability to choose 10/12bit color and full dynamic range disappears, you are stuck with 8-bit.  *The TV appears to take 24p content and makes them appear 240Hz using motion interpolation built into the TV, let me know if my understanding here is wrong.*

b.) Color Profile - Either YBCR444 or RGB, I selected RGB since I was told the RTX cards output RGB natively.  *RGB seems to be the only way to allow full color range 0-255*

c.) Bit Depth - 8-bit w/ dithering or 12-bit...  I cannot for the life of me figure out why 10-bit is not an option here, rumor online has it that the RTX cards do not support HDMI 2.2C yet and you must use DP or USB-C to get the full bandwidth... IS THIS TRUE? Please tell me if I can use a simple HDMI to USB-C adapter if this is the case."

Im looking to add a 4k IPS Monitor (27-32"" model, still researching for one, maybe https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27UK600-W-4k-uhd-led-monitor) just for entertainment usage, movies, netflix, browsing, ms office stuff only. No gaming as im putting this closer to my couch.

All my gaming is done on the 2x 1080p monitors at my desk. (i know 240hz is overkill, my days playing FPS games are way over, so im open to just running them at 144hz if that will help my new monitor combination)

Will my 1080ti support this? I had issues in the past with mismatched refresh rate monitors when i had a 240hz and a 60hz 1080 displays. I kinda bought a 2nd 240hz monitor just to fix this when my old 60hz monitor started having issues.

Basically, will the combo or 2x 1080p144hz and 1x 4k60hz monitors work? Will i have framerate mismatched issues when all 3 are on at the same time?

I've done quite a bit of searching, but most of the discussion about DCH vs standard seems to be around *how* to switch between them (e.g., with DDU), not *whether* to switch between them.

Now that TV set supports VRR and I would really want to take advantage of that with my RTX 2080 Ti.

I know the 2080 doesn't have a HDMI 2.1 port, but VRR doesn't require it to work (Xbox One, AMD cards).

With all those Samsung TV sets that support VRR and all the new TVs that will be HDMI 2.1 compatible (VRR being part of its specs), when will you finally support VRR through HDMI ?

I've bought my RTX 2080 Ti not that long ago, and I would be extremely disapointed if it happens that it will never support VRR (when any AMD card can)."

So something like 3 days ago completed my PC build and got a Gigabyte Aorus 2080 Ti Gaming OC and yesterday I got some time to fiddle around with overclocks. 

After applying +140 Mhz on core and +800 Mhz (no overvolting was involved) on memory it was finally stable (it was running at around 2100Mhz at the start and stopped at around 2070Mhz ish after the temperature hit), so I kept running a few benchmarks, Uniengine Heaven@1440p all maxed out and Superposition@4K Optimized to be specific and kept an eye out for temperatures. 

After some runs on the benchmarks I saw up to 81-82ºC which I thought was fine for RTX cards cause they do run hot, although after some research I saw people saying 80ºC was too much of a temperature for the card and it's longevity and I should probably aim for 70ºC. I don't know if I'm being paranoid or what but as soon as I saw that I immediately removed my overclock all together. 

So now I'm sitting here conflicted if I should or not re-overclock, thinking if it would kill my graphics card preemptively.

Could anyone enlighten me on the matter?

Oh and just to clarify I'm running a custom fan curve as aggressive as 100% @ 70ºC."

I downloaded MSI Afterburner, first it didn't work. It showed Fanspeed % = 100% but the fan did nothing. After the GPU reached \~85°C the fan startet and all of a sudden it worked fine. The fan-speed was @ 50% all the time, I didn' hear it.  


Then after maybe 2 hours it stopped, the temperature rises and the fan goes on and off.... every \~10 seconds.

The GPU temperature rised up to 90°C and the GPU throttled down and fucked all up. The fan did nothing, except this on and off thing...

i have little problem with my configs. I'm trying to record my game with nvidia shadowplay, but because of the weird fact that u cant choose your main audio device to capture audio from in nvidia, i dont get any sound. I've already set the system input for nvidia to my voicemod (voicemeter baa) output via system configs.

So the Game sound is comming in on windows, redirected to voicemeter input and then to the output, that is specified as input of the nvidia programm by the system configs. I can still record audio through the mic input of nvidia, where u can select the source, but its sad to have two audio inputs, but u have to use the secondary one because this program lacks some additional configs. And when i play with friends it would be nice to have two audio files seperat.

Do u have any idea wich audio port is the one nvidia gets its audio from. Or if nvidia plans to let u choose the input like in the secondary mic input?

nvidia,trias10,30,6,"G-Sync with very high refresh rate monitorsAm seeing monitors on the market now which have 240Hz refresh rates with g-sync, which got me to really thinking about g-sync, and wanted to ask if I'm understanding things correctly about how g-sync works. I've already read the blurbusters piece on g-sync so am familiar with the g-sync range and how it varies from v-sync.

&amp;#x200B;

So bottom line is, with g-sync active, your monitor's refresh rate changes to be equal to your game's FPS. So if you paid top dollar for a 144Hz g-sync monitor, but you only ever play really demanding games such that your FPS is, for the sake of argument, always 71, then your monitor's Hz is always 71 when you play. This means you're not really utilising that impressive 144Hz ever, sort of like buying a car which can drive at 144 mph, but you only ever drive it at 71 mph. Am I correct about this? In which case, you should save yourself some money and buy a 100Hz g-sync monitor instead, if you know that the games you play never go above 100 fps?

&amp;#x200B;

Which, if I'm correct then, means you will see absolutely ZERO gains by upgrading from a 144Hz panel to a 240Hz panel (both g-sync) if your games are only ever running at 70 fps? Which sort of begs the question then: who are these 240Hz g-sync panels for?

&amp;#x200B;

And this leads to my final question: I see a lot of posts saying stuff like ""you don't need g-sync with 240Hz"", and I'm trying to understand why people say this. I know that with no g-sync, if your game fps != your panel Hz, you get tearing. But assuming tearing only ever lasts for one full frame, that means the longest amount of time a torn frame will exist on your screen is 1 / monitor Hz. Meaning for a 60Hz panel, it's 1/60 secs, or 0.0167 secs. For a 240Hz panel it's 0.004167 secs. But that's assuming a torn frame is only ever one frame long, and I'm not sure if that's true. If your game sends a sequence of frames to the panel (say 10 frames), and all of them are torn, then you'll see tearing for a longer amount of time (10 \* 1/monitor\_Hz). So I am very much unsure about what effect a monitor without g-sync has on tearing as Hz increases. Is there some threshold where tearing will never be perceptible to the human (without g-sync), say if your monitor was 1000Hz? As the Hz goes up, torn images are shown on the screen for shorter amounts of time, and this is why people say you don't need g-sync at 240Hz?"

The problem is that most G-Sync monitors cost way more then I am wanting to pay for a problem that seems to me, quite easy to fix. If screen tearing occurs when the FPS of the GPU goes higher then the refresh rate of the monitor can't you just either buy a comparatively priced non G-Sync monitor with a higher refresh rate, or even just capping the FPS of the GPU?

I might be completely wrong as my knowledge of how monitors and G-Sync work is pretty small. But any help would be greatly appreciated."

Ok so, after the last driver update my whole video setup kinda died. I am using an old NVIDIA gtx 660ti that has been working great so far. Running windows 10, intel motherboard. So, the day of of the driver update, my video failed. After rebooting, the display was in black and white and the resolution was far less. Reinstall the driver, restart my machine. 

The pc starts, goes to bios, starts loading windows and after the windows logo my motherboards gives me a video error and fails to load video. 

I took out the video card, uninstalled the driver and geforce utility, reinstalled again, thinking it might be a driver problem. But the issue persists. I can seat the video card and install the driver with the card installed, but after the driver is installed and I reboot, it gives me a video error, and I am concerned my beautiful video card is at the end of its life, mostly cause I cant afford a replacement.

Here's are the cards that are available to me right now. an my idea about them from what I've been able to research during lunch.

I would like to watercool it eventually, This was my original plan for the MSI DUKE.

But it seems the Gigabyte cartds don't have alot of options for these.

&amp;#x200B;

Gigabyte RTX 2080Ti

\- Aorus Extreme Waterforce: Not really interested in the AIO watercooler

\- Aorus Extreme: enough available right now.

I've read some minor things with lousy cooler performance, As well as EKWB doesn't have any waterblocks for it.

But there are two other brands (can't think of the name now) that make waterblocks for these. Unsure about their quality &amp; availability in europe.

\- Aorus: price almost identical to the extreme. so prolly skipping this one

\- Gaming OC: reference design, handy for waterblock, but I think the EKWB doesnt fit properly with the extra fan connector at the top

\- Windforce: Think this is the exact same board as the gaming OC?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Occording to the RTX2080 ti owners club these should all work with the 366Watt Bios aswell?

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking at these right now Id say that I'm leaning most towards the Aorus Extreme, since the price I'll be getting will be relatively close to the gaming OC. which would be my second choice.

Vastly prefer the look of the MSI card, the FTW is just kinda ugly imho.. so a couple questions for anyone who knows things. Also if you have one or the other would just like general opinions.

1) Does EVGA's Precision X1 software work ok with all 2080 ti's? MSI's UI is dated and the X1 software looks great

2) I know cooling between the cards are similar, but which card performs better under load after an extended period of time? My case should have decent airflow (Corsair Obsidian 500D SE)

3) Which card is more likely to have Samsung memory vs the micron?"

I read as much as I could articles, posts, reddit, Nvidia forum to get informations.

First of all I have the XL2730z firmware V002 (not the zowie going to firmware V007)

As far as I understand the best way would be to create a custom refresh rate (143hz) from the Nvidia control panel and then I should enable G-Sync.

Some people are having black screen issue and so then were saying to create this custom refresh rate from CRU instead. 

Some people say it works flawlessly, some people don't. 

I just would like to sort things out and get someone telling me what would be the best way to get G-Sync working on this monitor ?

Other times I would get a signal loss from the card that would last a second or so.  Tried doing an update to the newest driver - didnt seem to help.  Did safeboot and ran DDU to uninstall everything.  
  
After reboot i am still getting shoddy performance.  Seems worse with newer drivers. On one run of superposition it would do 30-40 fps and then scream up to 150fps in the middle of the benchmark.  Other times it would be locked to 405mhz memory and not budge over 30/40fps.  It was also creating garbled audio over HDMI.   
  
Tried reseating it - no improvement.

nvidia,rchiwawa,8,0,"Power supply for NVLink/SLI 2080 Ti suggestions, thoughtsMy Ryzen 2700x machine currently has one EVGA 2080 Ti Hydro Copper and I have a line on a second card at a fair price.  I am going to be replacing the current 1,000w Seasonic Prime Gold PSU with something a little beefier.  I would like to keep it Seasonic as they've been my brand of choice for getting on 2 decades now but their line tops out at 1,300W it seems.  

&amp;#x200B;

On paper, 1300w is enough power supply but I was thinking maybe stepping it up to a gold, platinum, or titanium PSU from EVGA or Corsair in the 1600w range.  Where I have concern is that I run Folding @ home when the computer is not in use and folding work units typically have the Ti sucking down about 330w-350w constantly and the CPU eats up 150w pretty consistently.  I learned in the P4 socket 423 days that overkill is the name of the game with PSU selection but I am just not sure how far is far enough.  

&amp;#x200B;

I would be very entertained by suggestions that the current 1,000 watt power supply is enough.

&amp;#x200B;

 I am more interested in whether a 1,600w unit going to be under utilized enough to keep the PSU fan from even cycling on.  Would a 1.600w unit be noticeably quieter than a similar quality 1,300w model?  For reference, I run my loop fans @ 900rpm and the pump at 60% because it is silent from my seated position and the coolant never has a  Δ greater than 8°C versus ambient no matter how hard and long I drive the CPU and GPU.  I want it as quiet as possible."

Before that, I was always forced to buy previous gen budget cards. This is the first time I can look at an entire catalog of cards, and I'm finding I have no idea what I'm doing anymore.

I was originally going to get a 2060. I was expecting a small windfall, and it turned out to be much, much higher than I though, and while most of it is going into savings, I have put in too much work to get where I am to not at least treat myself for once. So I'm opening the doors and am willing to splurge a bit in the 2070 range.

PC is plugged into a 1080p tv. No plans for 4k or anything high res, and I'm mostly upgrading to get better performance in VR (Elite Dangerous, using a Windows MR headset)

Also, I'm Canadian, so whatever price you recommend, double it. That should cover the USD-&gt;CAD conversion.

Looking at the most recommended vendor, EVGA, I'm presented with a wide range of options, and some of them even come in *black* (oooOOOooOOooo....). So what's the deal with that? I can assume at the higher end, they decided to put a twinturbo in, maybe heated leather seats, and a moonroof? Is there a trim package that offers the best value?

Lets say I decide to go against the internet, and pick MSI. After all, their GTX960 has been my workhorse for YEARS, and hasn't given me grief. Maybe that deserves some brand loyalty. Same question tho, what trim is the bread and butter?

Reviews don't help, and when I try to compare Dodge's cup holder placement to Mazda's ... well I've never owned a Mazda so I don't know what makes them popular... suffice to say no one seems to ever compare  within trim levels. They all just say ""Yo dawg, this 2070 is like 13% faster than a 2060! That's hella tight!"".

Anyway, all this is just giving me a headache, and making it more likely I'm just not going to bother. Maybe I should just buy a new car.... :/

so I was wondering if this specific monitor is actually G-Sync 'ready/stable'. I was searching through the G-Sync compatible monitor list on the official Nvidia homepage and I asked myself if the other models VG248/MG278/XG248 are somewhat firmware related to each other. For example the MG278Q is the 1440p version of the MG248Q, so basically both should be 'identical' firmware wise, but only one of them is officially listed as G-Sync Compatible.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I own the MG248QE monitor and am using the G-Sync Compatible feature (Gtx 1060 6GB), I get slight/minimal bright flickering during loadingscreens. In addition, my GPU will freeze randomly while playing and leave a visual picture split behind displayed by the monitor (one side brown, one side white). Nevertheless everything else works perfectly fine.

I've seen people say to connect it with a DVI cable, but my 2060 does not have a DVI connection, it has 3 DP's and a HDMI. Another problem is that my monitor does not have any DP connections so i can't try using a DP either. I am currently using a two sided cable, one with a DP connection (Connected to my GPU) and one with a DVI (connected to the monitor) but this also does not work. My NVIDIA drivers are all up to date, and i cannot seem to find a driver for the monitor, and i also can't enable 144hz through my monitor directly. Another thing is trying both a HDMI with my two sided cable, but when i do so, it recognizes my single monitor, as being dual monitors and i cant understand why. Also worth mentioning my friend has the same monitor and uses a DVI connection and his 144hz works.

The heat sync on this computer is pretty beat up and gives me some really bad temps, quite often so bad that the computer just shuts down and doesn't turns back on unless I drain the power and unplug it from the wall then back in.  
When i try and run games my fps is usually a pretty solid 40-60 and doesn't fluctuate much, but it gets some pretty serious stutter and i believe this is because of the temps. I've tried using afterburner to crank the fans up but I don't think it has a control chip so that's out of the question, i was wondering if there's any way to ""underclock"" a laptop gpu, if that even helps with temps and if so how I'd go about doing that. From the searching I've done there doesn't seem to be many people with the same stutter problem (imagine micro-stutter but the opposite of micro) so I have no clue how to go about that or whats even causing it.

I've recently upgraded my build with an EVGA RTX 2080 FTW3 ULTRA. Unfortunately, since this change my system performs worse than before. My CPU is constantly capped at 95-100% load during games, I do get high fps (100+) in most games but it doesn't feel smooth, with some audio stutters in-game and Discord. I have a second screen and I just can't watch a stream or multi task while playing a game like before. 

I had an MSI 1070 Gaming X and everything was fine.

Relevant information about my rig:

i5 6600k @ 4.2
16Gb RAM @ 2400
PSU Corsair Rmx 550w
Monitor : Acer  xb241h 1080p 144Hz

I recently tried the Intelligent Standbylist Cleaner and it seemed to give me better results and diminish the stutters. I've tried capping my FPS to 120 but my CPU still loads 100%, I might try 100 later.

The audio stutters definitely hint that my CPU is bottlenecking me. 

Only game that runs well is Witcher 3 at 100+ FPS and quite smooth like it should. CPU is still running full load but it seems to breathe a little more (no audio stutters).

Kingdom Come runs worse according to my tests.

I've benchmarked my rig with most of the known softwares and everything seems fine.

Any clues that might help me ?

I'm currently saving money for my new system. It's gonna be a high-end setup because I want to program stuff and do video editing. My friend wants to sell his 9700k and Maximus Hero X board for a good prize. I tested both and everything is fine.  
I still have my old GTX 970, but I want to replace it soon. My friend will borrow me his GTX 1060 for awhile.

Currently I'm not sure which GPU I should buy. I'm not into ray tracing and find it pretty much useless for gaming. However, most GTX cards are out of stock and most of them are overprized as hell. A GTX 1080 or 1080 TI would be an amazing choice, however they cost more than 1000 euros. The 1070's and 1070 Ti's are also overprized.

I looked arround and I don't get why Nvidia offers RTX cards with less VRAM. So, the RTX 2070 from EVGA (link here [https://de.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=08G-P4-1071-KR](https://de.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=08G-P4-1071-KR)) looks for me fine, as the prize for me is affordable.

**GIGABYTE OC WindForce** ( $440)- Haven't done much research.

I recently started playing Zen Studio's *Operencia: The Stolen Sun*, and it keeps killing the video after 20 minutes or so, even if I manually jack up the fan speed.

I recently installed a 2080 XC Ultra from EVGA and I noticed that the fan stop mode is not working.  I have good case airflow.  Currently I have 4-140mms running at 50% or so 2 intakes a bit faster for positive pressure.  

My new graphics card will get up to 55C and then start turning the fans on and off, on and off, and they make a click/scratch every time that sounds like a loud old HDD.  It's rather irritating.   I don't want to just run them at 20% all the time.  Fan stop and quiet operation are reasons why I paid for a beefier cooler from a reputable brand.  I  expect to hold onto this card for 5 years but if the fans are going to need to do this nonsense then I expect it will be a rather loud card in several years time as I generally run my computer 24/7.  I have never had such an issue with my pascal card before this.  Fan stop mode worked and my PC was always quite and cool unless I wanted to rev up the beast.

What's happening is that my card is drawing high amounts of power while idling.  GPU-Z reports nearly 40w just sitting around at the desktop.

## Non-Synthetic Benchmarks Notes

**Non-synthetics are for the most part stable too. Not sure how OpenGL Superposition suddenly got so many more frames while the score stayed nearly the same. Looking at my sheets though I probably accidentally used the minimum FPS from the last test instead of the average. The VR score is weird too. **

## Built-In Game Benchmarks Notes

**Arkham Knight got thrashed by this release. Other than the insane FPS drops, several smoke effects also refused to run properly. 

Also of note is that the AK, DXMD, and FH benchmarks had audio issues, as in the audio would either play or wouldn't. When it did play, it played correctly. 

The Division continues the trend of crashing if you try to run a benchmark more than once per play session when in DX12 mode.**

## Driver 419.35 Notes

**What an absolute shitshow. The majority of tests saw a decrease in performance, several of them over the 3% notoriety threshold.**

## Recommended WHQL Display Driver for Pascal GPUs

**Unless you really want to play Apex, you're going to want to stick with 419.17. This driver should never have been put forward as anything other than a hotfix driver.**"

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in need of help here. So, I got an LG UK6500 4K HDR TV. It's plugged into my GTX 1070. So first off, having both displays plugged seems to create all sort of stability problems : I have parasites, blinking displays and all sorts of stuff. But it settles down while I'm in a play session, so whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

Where I'm really going crazy is about the whole HDR setup. SDR content are honestly not that great, and I can't seem to find a good enough setting to get reasonable colors. But HDR is by far the worst, it's unbelievably dark -and the more I try to solve the problem, the worse it seem to be getting. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here's a call for help: what kind of settings do you guys have in your Nvidia drivers regarding colors and stuff while plugged into a 4K HDR TV, both for 4K and 1080p? I'm really going insane here.

nvidia,AromaticRobot,0,1,"RTX 2070 boosting weirdly.Hi, asking if anyone has had problems with RTX cards starting to boost weirdly after time.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought MSI RTX 2070 armor few months ago, it initially boosted after oc scanner to about 2025 and was running the card at 1960-2000Mhz in games. Today i tried to play battlefield V but it was laggy and unplayable. Noticed that my card wouldn't boost past 1650Mhz. It runs at 50-55°C and still wont boost higher than 1650Mhz. I opened afterburner and if I set manual overclock to fixed Mhz, the card would go to that frequency but never over it. so it didn't boost at all.

Did a DDU and installed 419.35 drivers again, ran OC scanner from afterburner. Oc scanner set the curve to 2010Mhz on 1000mV and 2070 at 1125mV. Seems ok to that point.

&amp;#x200B;

After that I ran Timespy and while running it the card wouldn't boost past 1860, mainly it stayed at 1680-1710Mhz.

This resulted a graphics score of 8603.

That is way lower score that i got earlier. A month ago i got a graphics score of 9694.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think is happening with my card and does anyone have possible solutions?

nvidia,XanarGaming,4,1,"Is it possible for my sound card to make the fan sensor on my GPU go nuts?Hello!

So recently I upgraded my GTX 970 with a GTX 1060 and had some sort of fan-issue. The fan would spin to 100% and nearly every tool reportet the fan speed at 0%.

I then removed my soundcard (Soundblaster Z) and since then the problem seems to be gone. I can change the speed of the fan with tools like Firestorm.

Now my question is: Is it possible that the sensor on my GPU was getting signals from my Soundcard, causing it to misread the fan-speeds?"

nvidia,oreo1298,0,2,"RTX 2080 Ti Possibly FailingHey, I have a 2080 ti that I got on Oct 4th, everything has been good on it, no issues. My plan when I got the card was to watercool it, I saw how many people were complaining about failure, so I wanted to wait a few months to be sure I didn't get a defective one. 

About 2 weeks ago I installed my watercooling kit with the EK-Vector block for my 2080 ti and I've been happy with the temperatures since.

This morning I turned my PC on and the desktop was artifacted on both my monitors but it only lasted a few seconds. Obviously worried, I reinstalled my drivers and did a clean install. I restarted my computer a few times and they haven't shown up again. I played Metro Exodus for like 10 mins to see if I ran into any problems and it ran like normal. 

Was this possibly a 1 time thing or should I start filling out the RMA and get my aircooler back on?"

Now i know they're upwards of 400$, because i almost considered getting a i5 9600k which is cheaper WITH a motherboard combo and supposedly quicker but then i don't wanna replace my 230$ z270 mobo i just bought last year. 

&amp;#x200B;

So back to the i7 7700k, should i just pull the trigger? Or just wait on it and just get a new mobo/chip set up in the future because the i5 6600k will suffice, i honestly should just overclock it but i have no clue how to and i mean i even have a H5 Universal Cyrorig cooler on it xD.

&amp;#x200B;

nvidia,Mejain,37,1,"New Monitor Advice QueryHi folks,

I managed to pick up a RTX 2070 at an absolute steal when my GTX 1070 bit the dust but soon after that my monitor decided it quite missed the 1070 and packed in too.

I'm looking for a new monitor ASAP as a result as I can't use my PC without one but with it being so close in proximity time-wise to spending the money on a 2070 i'm a bit more strapped cash-wise than i'd like. As a result i'm having to shop at more of the budget end for the specs that i'm looking for.

I do a lot of gaming and really notice higher framerate (and indeed 144hz helps a lot with some of the games I play), but have never gone higher than a 1080p monitor.

Right now I can grab a deal on either of these two monitors:

Acer Predator XB271HA 27"" 1080p 144hz (GSync) - [https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/predator-model/UM.HX1EE.A09](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/GB/content/predator-model/UM.HX1EE.A09)

Element Gaming 27"" 1440p 144hz (FreeSync) - [https://www.ebuyer.com/838555-eg-27-qhd-144hz-1ms-gaming-monitor-gs27-v2](https://www.ebuyer.com/838555-eg-27-qhd-144hz-1ms-gaming-monitor-gs27-v2)

The Acer is around £50-80 more.

With Nvidia now supporting FreeSync the latter monitor is tempting, but I don't have any information on whether it works with this particular monitor aside from a couple of user reviews on the internet stating that it does. This monitor doesn't show up on Reddit Gsync compatibility master list and I can't find much confirmation elsewhere. The Acer, however, would have guaranteed support due to GSync but be stuck at a lower resolution and is a new (other) item as part of the deal.

Would Acer's GSync chops and better-known brand outweigh the Element's higher resolution and very attractive price point?

Any advice or alternative suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time."

nvidia,TheTinker_,4,1,"Nvidia Shadowplay - How to get 3 Audio Tracks for Recording# Introduction 

I have neglected to create this post for a long time, mostly due to my lack of faith in the method. But after a day of troubleshooting, for the purposes of recording gameplay with Nvidia Share/Shadowplay and having the benefit of 3 audio tracks, a feature typically reserved for more professional and performance hungry software, this is the only method by which you can do so until Nvidia adds the option themselves.

If you don’t feel like reading you can just flick through the screenshots and copy the settings shown, but I’m not taking the blame if you miss something important.

DISCLAIMER: I realise OBS + NVENC Encoding is technically better (it has more option + features), this is just for the few random people that would rather use Nvidia Share over OBS.

# THE REQUIREMENTS

Voicemeeter Baa/Potato

* You're going to need Voicemeeter Baa or Voicemeeter Potato. Either will work, but this guide will be assuming you have Baa installed. The only difference between the two is that Potato has many more options but can be overwhelming if you do not know what you're doing.
* With how I’ve set up Voicemeeter in this guide mean that it must ALWAYS BE RUNNING ON YOUR COMPUTER FOR YOU TO HAVE AUDIO. On my i5-6600k this uses anywhere from 1%-5% of my CPU, so if CPU usage is a problem for you abort the mission now.
* [https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/baa.htm](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/baa.htm)
* [https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm](https://www.vb-audio.com/Voicemeeter/potato.htm)

Virtual Audio Cable

* This program is fundamental to making this work. I recommend downloading VB-Cable and not Hi-Fi, as Hi-Fi in my experience can cause issues with audio (crackling/stuttering).
* [https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm)

GeForce Experience

* If you’re reading this, I assume you’ve already got this installed. Otherwise, why the heck are you looking up guides for free software you don’t have?
* [https://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/download](https://www.geforce.com/geforce-experience/download)

A Microphone

* So we can hear your beautiful voice.

Friends

* I’m assuming you have friends, otherwise, why do you need 3 audio tracks?

&amp;#x200B;

# THE METHOD

**STEP 1**

Reference Screenshot (Playback Devices) [https://pasteboard.co/I0cc1Qm.png](https://pasteboard.co/I0cc1Qm.png) 

After installing all of the required software, open up your computers sound settings. In your sound settings, there should be 4 tabs; Playback, Recording, Sounds and Communication. Select Playback. This is where your computers sound output devices (speaker/headphone ports) are listed. With the installation of Voicemeeter and Virtual Audio Cable, there should be 3 new devices listed here. These devices are “Cable Input”, “Voicemeeter Aux Input” and “Voicemeeter Input”.

While in this menu, make note of which audio device you’re using to listen to sound on your computer as you’re going to need to know it later. 

Right click on Voicemeeter Input and select “Set as Default Device”. 

Right click of Voicemeeter Aux Input and select “Set as Default Communication Device”.

Doing this will set Voicemeeter Input to be the audio device that all non-communication programs on your computer will use to play sound. If you can no longer hear anything on your computer, do not worry- this is normal and we will be fixing this later.

Setting Voicemeeter Aux Input to be the Default Communication Device, in theory, makes it so all programs used for communication (i.e Discord, Skype, Teamspeak, etc.) use this device for playing sound. However this is a bit finicky, so you may have to individually set your communication programs to use this sound device.

Once done, close your sound control panel and open Voicemeeter Baa. 

&amp;#x200B;

**STEP 2**

To start, a basic explanation of Voicemeeter. Everything explained will be necessary to set up 3 audio tracks and everything not explained is not necessary.

NOTE: Input = Where sound enters or is created, Output = Where sound exits.

Voicemeeter allows for hardware inputs, AKA microphone inputs, to have their sound be directed to specific hardware outputs. Virtual inputs are a form of hardware input, except, as their name implies, they are virtual. There are also virtual outputs that are like virtual inputs but instead output. 

A1, A2 and A3 refer to hardware output 1, 2 and 3. 

B1 and B2 refer to virtual output 1 and 2.

When A1 is selected underneath a hardware input, all sound from that hardware input will be outputted at hardware output 1. This is the same for all outputs and inputs.

For each hardware input, there is a section labelled “intellipan”. Right click on this setting to cycle through a series of different voice effects, including a voice modulator,  right-left stereo panner and a voice colourisation adjuster. If you want to know how these work, play with them in your own time.

&amp;#x200B;

**STEP 3**

Reference Screenshot (Voicemeeter Settings) [https://pasteboard.co/I0cd5IW.png](https://pasteboard.co/I0cd5IW.png) 

NOTE: I recommend simply copying the settings in this screenshot and skipping to Step 4, but if you want to know exactly what to do please read through the entirety of Step 3.

To begin configuring Voicemeeter, set hardware output 1 (A1) to be your computers main output, aka where sound normally comes out of your computer. In the screenshots, this device is called “Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)”. Then set hardware output 2 (A2) as Cable Input.

Next, set any hardware input to be your microphone and then set another to be Cable Output. In the screenshots, my microphone is called “Microphone (2- ATR USB microphone)”.

Underneath Virtual Inputs, click the A1 button on both Voicemeeter VAIO and Voicemeeter AUX. These two virtual inputs correspond to the devices you set as your default and default communication devices in your sound control panel and turning A1 on will allow you to hear the audio from these devices. 

You’re also going to want to enable A2 for Voicemeeter AUX.

For both Cable Output and your microphone, right-click on the intellipan menu until you see the panel labelled position. You then should drag the square icon on the panel to the bottom corners for each device. For example, if I drag the square to the bottom left corner of Cable Output’s panel, I would want to drag the square to the bottom right corner of my microphone.’s panel. What this does is force each device to only output to the left or right channel of a stereo sound channel. 

Enable A2 and B2 for your microphone and enable B2 for Cable Output.

&amp;#x200B;

**STEP 4**

Reference Screenshot (Nvidia Share Audio Settings) [https://pasteboard.co/I0ccA2P.png](https://pasteboard.co/I0ccA2P.png) 

Now that the Voicemeeter configuration is over, let’s connect Voicemeeter to Nvidia Share.

Open up the Nvidia Share menu (default shortcut is Alt-Z). Click on the microphone icon and go to settings. Enable “Separate both tracks” and change your microphone source to be “Voicemeeter Aux Output”. Now exit out of Nvidia Share.

&amp;#x200B;

**STEP 5**

Now technically you’re done. But before I get a bunch of confused replies asking how to get 3 audio tracks using this method, I’m going to explain it here and now.

This method does not actually make a 3rd audio track. What it actually does is combine the microphone and discord audio together on one stereo track. Each source gets its own left and right audio channel to itself. To split these tracks up into separate mono tracks (mono audio plays the same sound across all speakers), most video editing software supports the ability to split a stereo track into two mono tracks and if in doubt the free software Audacity has support for this feature.

As far as I can tell, doing this does not decrease the audio quality of your microphone (people with super high-end mics might notice a difference) and the quality of recorded discord chatter is not decreased either. I’ve chalked this up to Discord not actually processing voice in stereo and instead converting to mono (Bots still play sound in stereo) and most mics don’t typically make use of their stereo functionality- and why would you want stereo mic functionality when recording gameplay? (if there is an actual use case let me know).

Regardless, congratulations! You’re done! Enjoy recording using Nvidia Share with 3 Audio Tracks! For those who want a bit more explanation as to how the whole audio system works, read the epilogue found below.

&amp;#x200B;

**EPILOGUE**

With the setup of Voicemeeter, we’ve configured the program to do two things. First if all, it is taking the audio from your computer’s general applications (games, web browsers) and is mixing it with audio from your communication apps (Discord, Skype, Teamspeak, etc.) so that you can hear it through one set of headphones/speakers even though it appears to Windows that they are playing on two completely different devices. In other words, Voicemeeter VAIO + Voicemeeter AUX = Hardware Output.

The second thing that Voicemeet is doing is outputting your communication audio through the Cable Input. Cable Input send it’s audio to Cable Output, which is where the audio is converted to be on a single stereo channel. This allows you to hear the audio in dual channel stereo but have Nvidia Share receive it as only a single channel. The same is done for your microphone, although it is a lot less complex since we don’t have to reprocess the microphones sound, it’s already a hardware input. 

These two devices, now on separate stereo channels, are then routed to a virtual output (B2). Your PC treats this as a microphone, so it’s only a matter of selecting this virtual output in Nvidia Share as your microphone and then splitting the audio into mono tracks after recording for editing. "

Since my upgrade to 2K I see that my 970 starts to struggle and with its 3.5+0.5GB VRam I'm thinking about an upgrade to my rig, seeing that i have to render on FHD and upscale it to 2k on more modern games to get 70+ FPS.

nvidia,misfitskid,9,1,"Non-Gsync 144Hz monitor with nVIDIA cardHey all,

My PC specs are:

* nVIDIA GTX 1070ti
* Intel Core I7-7700k
* 16GB RAM

I was looking to finally go from 1080p/60hz to a 2k/144hz monitor and the gysnc monitors are quite out of my price range for now.

My question was would it be worth it with those specs to just get a freesync monitor that's 144hz just for the higher refresh rate and resolution?

I generally play most new games and without vsync on I try to aim for 75+ fps by tweaking various settings.

[This](https://www.pccasegear.com/products/41706/acer-kg271ua-qhd-144hz-freesync-27in-gaming-monitor) was the monitor I was aiming to get.

I play MMO's, Overwatch, etc so the response rate and 144hz would come in handy. Amazing popping colours don't mean too much to me, i'm just looking for a good runner at a good price and this monitor doesn't really have much competition at this price that I can see.

Was curious if anyone has this monitor and could advise? Or if someone who understands monitor specifications better than I to perhaps be able to tell if it's somewhat decent. I've tried looking it up in the Reddit but unfortunately nothing came up.

I'm looking to upgrade my current system's graphics card, as my current 1070 isn't up to scratch for my 1440p 144hz needs. I need to stick with a Nvidia card however, as i have a G-sync monitor and love the feature too much to give up.

Firstly, I was hoping that the 20 series would satisfy my needs,  but after releasing and being ridiculously expensive for not that much of a performance gain, it didn't seem very attractive to me. (I couldn't care less about ray tracing :/)

Then, after being let down by the 20 series, I was hoping that the release of AMD's new GPU('s) would push down the prices of the 20 series. However, it seems like that is another flop, with AMD's announced Radeon VII being almost the exact same price to performance as the 2080 and very unlikely to put any pressure on Nvidia to lower their prices 

(ノಠ益ಠ)ノ彡┻━┻

My final option is to buy the 1080ti, but I feel that if new cards are released soon, buying the 1080ti will of been a very poor choice, especially considering the new technology that may be added.

I keep ~250 FPS in Overwatch at all times, so it is not a performance issue. I have a GTX 1080 and i7 8700K, which is more than capable of playing Overwatch at 144+ FPS whilst watching a YouTube video. The issue, however, underlies with the latest Nvidia driver.

nvidia,CaptainBigPixel,54,1,"My/Your GPU History and Purchasing PatternsGood Evening everyone i was reviewing my purchase history since i got into desktop PC gaming a few years back.

I was curious what GPU's all of you purchased over the years and why.

Here is my own:

2006 Got into desktop PC gaming with a 8800GTX, like many i wanted to play Crysis, it was GLORIOUS, i will always remember being in awe like so many others at its beauty and i felt special i could experience it on the best GPU possible at the time.

This entire experience was a stark contrast from the laptops i had been gaming on all these prior years, i swore never again to get one.

2010 Time to upgrade, switched over to the GTX 480, i took this upgrade as a baseline for when and how to upgrade my GPU's. The GTX 480 gave me a 3.5x increase in performance at a slightly lower cost than what the 8800 GTX cost me 4 years earlier, i was very pleased.

2016 Pascal hits the market, after 6 years it was time to upgrade again and i got a 1070 for 3x the performance increase, i was hoping for 3.5x like last time, but i knew that if i didn't get the 1070 then it would be another 2 years before i had a chance to upgrade again. I could have gone the 1080 but it was far to expensive, more than the prior two cards i had gotten and for 2 years extra wait and a disappointing 3x performance increase i was not about to reward Nvidia with more cash than usual.

&amp;#x200B;

From this you can deduce that my purchasing pattern is to wait for 3x or more performance, and i always purchase around the 500 dollars mark, exception made with the 8800GTX but it was a 5x improvement over its predecessor and the best card for Crysis at the time.

I wonder how long it will take for the 1070 to be replaced by a 500 dollar mark card and bring 3x or more the performance increase.

Thing are not looking bright if it took 6 years for the 1070 to beat the GTX 480 and improvements have been steadily reducing over the years. On the up side, this card will last me a very long time!

&amp;#x200B;

What have you guys purchased and why? Do you have a fixed budget you don't go over, do you purchase around a certain amount of extra performance increase over your current card.

Would love to hear from you."

&amp;#x200B;

I recently got this 2080 Ti and I have a weird issue where the card runs in x8 3.0 according to GPU-Z. 

&amp;#x200B;

The motherboard is a Gigabyte X399 Designare EX, and the card is sitting in the first slot which is a x16 slot, this slot does not share bandwith with anything else, still GPU-Z shows x8 3.0. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can change the amount of PCI-E lanes of this slot in the BIOS to x4, and when I do that GPU-Z reports that the card runs at x2 3.0, so once again it reports using only 50% of the lanes despite the slot being 4x. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have other slots, and it is the same in my other x16 slot, it shows as running in x8, if I put the card in a x8 slot it shows as x4, and a x4 slot as x2.

&amp;#x200B;

i.e wherever I put the card, it shows in GPU-Z as running at 50% of the amount of available lanes for that slot. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the funny thing is that in Nvidia Control Panel, and ""System Information"" it always shows the correct bus speed, currently, PCI Express x16 Gen3

I've un-installed and then re-installed drivers, tried GPU-Z, Nvidia Inspector and all else but i seriously can't fix it. Hopefully ya'll have a method to fix this. 

&amp;#x200B;

(keep in mind that normally my Core Clock should be on 1354 mhz whilst the memory should be on 1752 mhz)

SO Yesterday I attempted at OC my gtx 1080 ti because I wanted more FPS while playing The Division at Ultra settings.   


I have OC before and before OC i searched for results of different 1080 ti OC and they all seemed to be around 2100MHz on the core closk and 5800 on the memory clock. I started by just getting a normal bench without OC using HeavenBenchmark. I increased voltage to max and power limit to max. I then increase the core clock by 50 and the Mem clock by 500, from 1550 and 5500 and benched again. I did this until I started getting diminishing values in results and/or the program would crash. I settled around 80Mhz on the Core clock and 600 on the memory clock. I ran 3 tests, Not all same results, I guess from constant testing, but it gave me no problems. I applied OC and turned on Division and didnt see much of a change. I turned on Darksiders 3 and played that for about 2.5 hours then SHUT DOWN! My entire Pc turned off. I assume it was my OC because I never had that happen before. I turned OC off. and began playing again for another 4 hours with no problems.  


Now, I entered everything on my computer on PCPartpicker and it said the recommended wattage was 419-429. I was told to give yourself 100-200 watts of headroom to breathe. So I assumed I was safe with my 600w 80+ PSU. I also read that a small OC to the 1080 only really gives about a 2-8 FPS increase in games so im thinking is it really worth it to OC or did I do it wrong?  


Do you guys know why it shut off? The only thing that maybe was off was my Mem clock which was at 6100, while other people avg for 1080 ti was about 5800.  


\*\*Side Note\*\*  


Im not sure why but when I play The Division it uses close to 100% of my CPU and about 60-80% of my GPU when its the only program running. I usually have to play at a much lesser quality in order to alleviate some of the stress but it doesnt really work. Even playing at medium to high settings is rough and runs my CPU temps between 78-84 Celsius (which i just learned was bad). So I thought of OC my CPU as well, but If my PC shut off from OC my GPU by a bit then im scared what will happen if i tried that.

* i5-6500k
* ASRock Z170 (don't remember exactly model but it's cheap, not an Extreme)

He's only looking at GPUs, CPUs, and motherboard right now, the rest will come later.

As far as GPUs go, I'm trying to help him decide between some options. Here's his setup: primary gaming monitor, 1080p 144Hz. After that, he's got 2 secondary monitors, both 1080p. He streams so we need to factor in whatever overhead power should be included to get his system running smoothly at 1080p 144Hz while also live streaming.

He could keep his 980 Ti and get a second one for SLI. The 900 series is quite dated now though and even though the 980 Ti is still strong, I'm not sure how much longer it will last.

He could upgrade to a 1070 Ti, then buy a second one later down the road for SLI. This seems like the best option. 1070 Ti looks like it's still a super performer at that resolution/framerate, SLI it and he gains a bit of future proofing, right?

He could get a 2070 which would give performance on par to a 1080, but I hear the 2070s don't support SLI so the single card may not be able to drive future games at 144Hz on 1080p.

Or he can wait and save more and just get a 1080 Ti. Thing is, I feel like the 1080 Ti is overkill for 1080p.

What's the best choice here for his setup, taking streaming into consideration, and wanting it to last 3+ years?

FWIW, his CPU upgrade will probably be to an i7 8700K, and the associated motherboard upgrade that comes with it since I hear the Z170 cannot run the Coffee Lake CPUs."

nvidia,unclenumbers,2,1,"Just Some Speculation about Nvlink and why it exists at all on consumer cardsNvidia's new RTX series GPUs have replaced SLI with Nvlink, which has drastically improved bandwidth over SLI and even allowing cards to share VRAM. However, SLI seems to be more and more an unsupported technology as single cards continue to be hassle free, and SLI scaling not great. 

So then why does Nvlink even exist on consumer cards? SLI isn't used much, so why give it a huge upgrade? My theory is that for SLI to properly work, the system would need to see the block of GPUs as one big card, so that everything would work the same. 

This would require an insane amount of bandwidth, much more than SLI's 2GB/s, and probably more than 100 GB/s. Each GPU would need to be able to get at the other's memory at the same speed that the other GPU can. Nvidia will probably also push Split-frame rendering (SFR), as each card can access the other's memory at the same speeds that the other card's core can, and SFR removes the need for frame prediction, because it's one frame, split over multiple cards. If this happens, Nvidia would be able to push SLI once again as the go-to technology for great performance once again."

So I tried everything, don't even get me started. Legacy drivers, factory laptop drivers, latest drivers, with DDU tool, downgrade to Win 8.1 again, no luck.

Chipset drivers too.. everything.
I've spent two FULL days if not more on this piece of shit.

In device manager, NVIDIA gpu is behaving weirdly but it can be installed and registered with no errors (with all drivers I tried).

but there is no NVIDIA Control Panel. All I get is a loading icon from right clicking desk top, and starting the control panel from start doesn't do anything. In fact it can start Intel graphics control panel instead.

Going from 760/850m to HD4600 on this CPU is a fucking tragedy, we can't even co op minecraft over here.


What the fuck is this and why is it still a problem?

None of the games register the GPU at all. Flatout 2 would never go below 60fps on the dedicated GPU. Device manager though does recognize it eventually, sometimes it likes to stay Hidden though.

TBH i really don't know how to clearly describe this issue because it is not the same as any other issues that are already found atm. It looks like a screen tearing but in a much worse way. A fairly big portion of the display (like 1/20) on screen is 'twisted' like the tearing effect, after 0.05 sec it flashes away and this occurs at a pretty noticeable rate. See below 'demonstration' of the effect when it occurs:

When i go to the desktop and do nothing, no issue at all.

Then i restarted my PC, the issue then seems to be gone.

I’m going to be building a gaming pc soon and trying to figure out whether to get a 2080 or a 1080ti as they have similar prices.

With the gaming pc I’m building so expensive I dislike the idea of DLSS as I would like it to render the frame in true 4k.

I have an MSI Gaming X 1080ti and 3 monitors. My primary monitor is an Asus PG278QR @ 1440p/144hz, and I have 2 Asus VG248QE @ 1080p/144hz. I've been keeping the 1080p monitor on the right side turned off lately as I haven't been using it that much, but I noticed about 2 weeks ago when it's on I get no signal on it. If I got into the Nvidia control panel and look under the ""Set up multiple displays"" tab the monitor shows up (with the model number as well) but not enabled. If I try to enable it one of two things happens. Either the second I click on the check box my PC will freeze and I have to hold the power button to shut it down, or it will highlight that line and give me the ""apply changes"" prompt but the box won't actually have a check mark and nothing has changed. I originally thought it was just a dead cable so I bought a new one but that didn't change anything. I borrowed a laptop from work with a full size DP port and tested the cable and monitor and it worked fine. I also switched the cables for my main monitor and the 1080p one and it still didn't work. I even tried plugging in just the 1080p monitor with no luck. So as far as I can tell the cable, port on my monitor, and port on my GPU are all good.

I know for a fact that the monitor was working on the 416.16 drivers so I used DDU to remove the ones I had installed and rolled back to that version and I still had the same issue, then I tried a clean install of the most recent driver with no luck. I've tried it across 416.16(last known working driver), 416.34, and 416.81. All give me the same issue. I'm really not sure where to go from here, as everything works separately, but when the monitor is plugged into my PC it doesn't work. Any bit of information would help at this point."

I run a 4 display setup, plus have an Oculus rift. Anytime I want to use my Rift, despite having enough inputs on the GPU I must unplug one of my displays. This breaks multi monitor setups, and is just a general inconvenience.

With little interest in the 20 series for various reasons, I never looked too closely at their specs. After growing tired of the problematic setup, I've started to consider the 2080ti in hopes of a higher display count. Unfortunately those too are also limited to only 4 displays with the same 7680x4320 essentially halting my upgrade path for now.

nvidia,AMSolar,16,1,"1080ti vs 2080 - just chill the f out!So I've been fascinated recently about how people form biases.
Being fairly neutral about nvidia I was able to notice two large groups of people with opposite biases.

There's one group that says that 2080 is plainly better and everyone who buys 1080ti is stupid.
And there's another large group that says that 1080ti perform the same but cost less than 2080, so anybody who buys 2080 is stupid.

But in reality truth is somewhere in between. In fact value choice between those two is so similar, that your lunch money will make a bigger difference. Yet people have to sway facts one way or another. They have to band together for religious reasons.

I know you guys all had math in school, you all can run numbers, you know basically the same deal. Yet you have to argue one way or another! Just chill, $700-$750 1080ti and $800 2080 has pretty much the same value no matter how you spin it.

Hey you found that discounted $600 1080ti? Congrats! But don't spout anger at your buddy who's going to get 2080 at $650 on black friday. You're both got good deals! Enjoy!

Those who saw all these tests where 1080ti vs 2080 perform similarly tend to forget that patches for 10-series are already mature and likely to improve cards performance much less than that of 20-series. So 2080 is definitely will be worth extra $20-100 in 1-2 years.

And those who think that patches will make 2080 so much better that will perform twice faster or something?

Not knowing as much as I should about computers, I don't know what card would best fit my needs or if RTX is worth it. My needs being 1080p gaming at 144hz and running three monitors (only one for gaming).

This being, I was looking at the 1070ti, 1080ti, 2070, and 2080. I am leaning more towards the 1080ti and 2070 since I feel they have a better cost per performance ratio (the 2070 be speculative at the moment).

I am a noob. While googling on the internet and talking to some noobie friends, I think I still have some open questions. Could someone kindly help me with the answers?

Is the new card ok for the setup, or is it too powerful etc? Does it make sense? 

2) Should I rather buy the 6gb version? Or is the 3gb ok, again, when looking at my setup?

3) The 760 pulls 150  and the 1060 120 watt - so can I just plug it into my power source and I am ready to go?

4) Or is there a card which would fit my setup better?

Thank you!

Hello all,

I'm upgrading my gpu from a reference RX480 8gb to an Msi GTX 1070ti. I followed what most people recommend, uninstalling Amd drivers using DDU in safe mode. I used the ""clean and shutdown"" button as recommend for changing your gpu.

After doing this, I installed my new shiny 1070ti and powered up the pc. Everything looked good, LEDs fired up on the 1070ti. But I'm not able to get a display on my monitor, I tried display port, HDMI. Nothing.

I reinstalled my old RX480 and it still works, displaying on my monitor. I tried reinstalling the 1070ti many times and am unable to get any display.

Another odd thing I've noticed, I attempted to just run on my integrated graphics - this also would not show display (no GPUs in the pc).

What have I done wrong? Should I just wipe my pc and install my os?

nvidia,Dr-Fish_Arms,12,1,"EVGA 2080 Step Up to 2080 TiI built a really nice PC two years ago with a 4K monitor. Since There were no 4K capable cards at the time, I bought a GTX 960 for $200 and decided to wait for a year or so. The GTX 10XX line came out, but the cryptomining boom hit and prices soared, so I waited still.

I was excited to see this new generation of cards, but without any viable competition from AMD, the prices are obnoxious.

Unfortunately, I've already waited two years, and if I wait even longer for the next generation of cards, or for AMD to release a competitive product and drive prices down, I'll be looking at 3-4 years since I built this awesome computer before I'd be able to play games in 4K.

I think I'm just going to bite the bullet and shovel some cash into Nvidia's greedy sweaty palms. I'm torn between the 2080 and 2080 Ti.

Then I have three months to decide if I want to spend the extra cash for the 2080 Ti, and I have a card while availability of the 2080 Ti is catching up.

* How often do aging GPUs underperform with a brand new game without first doing a driver update?  I'd like to know if it happens rarely or frequently.



* When an aging GPU *does* underperform with a brand new game, how reliable is Nvidia with updating the drivers to allow that GPU to perform up to its real capability?



For example, I saw a benchmark from 2017 that showed the 1070 being 56% faster than the 980 Ti in Wolfenstein New Colossus.  The disparity made little sense, given that the 1070 was only 4% faster than the 980 Ti in Doom 3.  Both games were rendered with Vulkan on id Tech 6.

nvidia,johnny1711,2,1,"Just in case you're wondering why ShadowPlay has less of a performance impact than OBSPrerequisite that most people know by now: There are two facets to how much performance impact recording has, the encoding of the captured images into a video stream, and the actual capturing of the images. The encoding can be done via NVENC by any program, but the way ShadowPlay (or ""Nvidia Share"") captures the image is done through the NvFBC / NvIFR APIs, which tend to have significantly less performance impact than other capture methods.

Now to the part that most people don't tend to know: The reason OBS (or any other consumer capture software) doesn't support NvFBC / NvIFR. It's not because they're lazy or don't want to, it's because in third party applications, NvFBC / NvIFR is only available on Quadro and Tesla cards.

That is why there will never be a third party capture application that performs as well as ShadowPlay (that you can use on your GTX / RTX card), these APIs are simply not available to you, unless you use Nvidia's own capture software."
nvidia,nbohr1more,4,2,"Ray Tracing commentsI've been growing steadily more weary about the constant portrayal of RTX as a ""gimmick"".

RTX is infuriatingly expensive and proprietary, certainly... but it cannot just be put into the same category as ""Hairworks"" or other Nvidia proprietary tech.

Why?

Because it is a general purpose computing structure.

Even if Nvidia never took the risk of including RT cores on it's GPU's, we would probably see a move to have the same sort of calculations accelerated in upcoming GPU's.

What do I mean by ""the same sort of calculations""?

Let's go back in time to 2007 when Crysis was one of the first games to include ""Parallax Occlusion Mapping"" (POM). 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOB63M1kHgg

How is POM calculated? It is ""ray tracing through a texture"".

This means that any hardware that can accelerate Ray Tracing can accelerate POM or effects like it.

Similarly, modern SSAO effects, such as SSDO include ""bounce"" calculations which could benefit from RT cores:

https://www.slideshare.net/jeannekamikaze/ssdo-52585061

Finally, most modern soft shadows techniques have some sort of tracing component even if they don't do full bounced lighting. Nvidia's HFTS shadows in Watchdogs 2 and The Division:

http://images.nvidia.com/geforce-com/international/comparisons/tom-clancys-the-division/tom-clancys-the-division-shadow-quality-interactive-comparison-001-nvidia-hfts-vs-nvidia-pcss.html

are already in commercial games and could be accelerated by RT cores.

Now, most of these techniques meet the GPU half way and limit ray tracing to a small amount of the workload but it's still work that requires GPU grunt and the more complex the scene the more work there is to do. Will Nvidia driver wizards be able to move this type work to the RT cores?  Time will tell, but it sounds plausible.

Therein lies part of the problem for RTX.

It is being sold as ""exotic new tech"" but we already have a few years of games that have some amount of ray tracing under the hood which makes the visuals approach fully ray traced graphics.

The ultimate problem for RTX as a brand is exactly this. We have Battlefield 3+ Frostbyte engines that have Enlighten based real-time Global Illumination. It's got 90% of the visual impact of ray tracing because most of it IS ray traced. 

It combines 3 different GI tech:

1) Old fashioned baked lightmaps which are Ray Traced offline

2) Probes which are based on Ray Traced lightmaps but do some intersection calculations

3) Very low resolution ""real time ray tracing"" to a temporal  lerped 3D texture for dynamic effects

Items 1 and 2 wont see any benefit from RTX. Item 3, however could grant much more fidelity to the dynamic effects seen in the game.

So what's the bottom line of this thread?

Ray Tracing as offered via RTX is positioned as leaning more towards ""real time"" lighting effects. It is sold as a hybrid solution where we already have hybrid ray tracing effects in existing games.

What is a comparable inflection point?

Doom 3 vs Half Life 2. 

In Half Life 2 lighting could move a little and dynamic objects picked-up scene lighting in a realistic way due to ""precomputed radiance transfer"".

Doom 3 did almost everything real-time and could have many more shadowed light sources in a scene.

Doom 3 did things that very few games did and even today most don't do them. We simply don't games where you are in dark corridors filled with lots of tiny moving light sources.

RTX (or tech like it) could enable something like this on a lesser scale. Some sort of gaming experience where lights are moving all over the place.

Soldiers with flashlights or laser scopes (etc). Knights with torches. Nobles with candles.

It's all on the cusp of being possible.

Even without RTX, it's already getting close with the power of current GPU's and techniques that approximate the look of ray tracing.

So what is RTX really about?

Nvidia is reusing Pro-graphics hardware in consumer tech in the hopes that consumers will help subsidize the development cost of this hardware.

Is this an exploitative strategy?

Yes... but Tensor and RT cores can still benefit gaming consumers even when not used explicitly for ray traced shadows, reflections or GI.

Bonus: Real Time Ray Tracing that runs on a Radeon 9500 or FX5200 (2003 GPU's):

This only happens when I'm playing Tekken 7 on max settings which this PC should be capable of handling. I have had this system OCd to 5.1 but pulled it back to 4.8 after the beep happened. This is not a POST beep because I will be in the middle of a game.   


I monitored the performance and noticed that for the GPU.. the GPU clock speed range is 139 and 1949 MHz and the card runs at max performance during games. This is the same for the Memory clock with the range of 810 being the minimum and 11088 being the maximum where it runs at. Is this because the load on the GPU?

Long story short I bought the EVGA 980Ti about 2 years ago.

2 weeks ago I decided after 2 years of not thinking about overclocking it I would give it a go. I done a ton of research and took the slowest and most efficient way possible.
I was adding 10+ on the core clock after every successful benchmark playthrough. After about 100+ and hours of testing my PC just shut down and wouldn't turn on with the GPU plugged in.

When the GPU died I went through the process of getting a new GPU via RMA. It came today.

My question is now do I attempt to OC again? I have 187 days warranty left. The thing I don't understand is people are telling me OCing will not harm my GPU yet it broke my 2 year old GPU and I didn't even do anytthing excessive.
Should I OC or just leave it? And what do you think broke my previous GPU?

In the latest [driver notes](https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/399.24/399.24-win10-win8-win7-desktop-release-notes.pdf#G7.843808) there's a bullet which has apparently been in multiple driver release notes but I've never seen until now:

&gt;Using power monitoring in GPU monitor tools causes micro stutter. \[2110289/2049879\] 

BINGO. Anyways, turning off Power in Afterburner will solve this annoying micro stuttering. Make sure to restart your PC after you untick power monitoring.

Here’s my opinion on the people swarming every post saying that buying a 20x series is dumb and a foolish decision. You refresh your page just waiting to brag about how you are choosing to “skip this gen” and pick up a 1080Ti for “dirt cheap,” yet you were probably saying the exact same thing at Pascal’s launch. No it isn’t comparing apples to apples because of the larger than normal price difference and displaying the entire family all at once as opposed to over time, yet it still holds the same general consensus. Getting a 1080Ti for cheaper a year after it’s release is just that. A year after it’s release. Technology is constantly changing, what’s released today is outdated tomorrow. I think the majority of people bragging about “saving so much money by waiting” are forgetting that the early adopters are the ones selling them their old cards. All of us got to experience the best of the best gaming for an entire year when you didn’t, so I’m not sure why they act like we’re the idiots for paying a premium to have just that, the best available. To all the people saying this is a minor improvement and marginal gap, just remember this thread when you post a year from now “Pick up used 2080 or wait for GFRTX LEATHER JACKET Ti Black edition”

nvidia,digitalformula,20,2,"Question re 2080Ti pre-orders in AustraliaHi all,

Pricing and should/shouldn't buy has already been well thrashed out on here but I have a question about pre-orders.  Specifically, pre-orders of the 2080Ti cards here _in Australia_.

On the Nvidia AU website, before they sold out, the info said this:

""Your order will ship on or around 11/10/2018.""

Being the Nvidia AU site, would that mean 11th of October or 10th of November?  I've asked Nvidia but their support is either useless or they lied on their website - doesn't matter what I ask or how many times I ask it, they just say ""No shipping dates are available yet.""  That includes sending them a screenshot of the site showing 11/10/2018.

Also, what is the priority of pre-orders vs store purchases?  Is there any such thing?  Asking as the 2080Ti cards are arriving ""on shelves"" on September 20th (8 days from today), according to the Nvidia launch stream.  Does that date apply to the U.S. only?  If not, what's the point of pre-orders if store purchases could be completed before pre-orders arrive?

Apologies for the potentially stupid questions but trying to figure how it'll all work.  I pre-ordered a 2080Ti as part of an upcoming gift project (lucky recipient!) but am having trouble getting my dates together.  Also wondering if I should cancel the pre-order and just hope I can grab it from the shelf before pre-orders hit buyers' mailboxes.

Thanks"
nvidia,funsanity,47,1,"Are these prices here to stay?Just thought of something if Nvidia changed the pricing and branding of the cards then we will probably see everything stay the same for the generations to come, we will be getting a 2180 at the price of the 1080ti and the 2180ti at the price of the titan. Also looking at this generation the ti seems like the card to get since based on cuda cores, memory and other specs it's a lot better than the 2080 and it's not the same as the titan was to the 1080ti where the titan had only slightly better specs than the 1080ti. Rtx is here for a while, Nvidia wouldn't change the whole branding and the inside of a card just to get a quick buck and run away.
  
  Companies usually never have drastically lower prices for their products, since they need to take into account that they have previous generations being sold at a particular price point even if AMD creates a miracle card only thing Nvidia might improve is the performance per dollar the biggest price drop we might see is maybe 100$ for the generations equivalent of the card.  Intel didn't do any drastic price cuts for their products when AMD made Ryzen, it is true that we are seeing more new tech coming in and Intel is now starting to innovate something, but still, the pricing doesn't change.
  
   What do you guys think? Maybe the pricing is awkward just because we have the regular version and the ti released at the same time and that might change in the future?"

nvidia,Tadae,137,14,"Buy 1080 Ti now or wait if I'm in no rush?Hey /r/nvidia,

I plan to use the GPU for machine learning and maybe a little bit of gaming (Read Dead Redemption 2, GTA V and that's it). I want the best GPU possible, but not overly expensive like the Titans. Should I buy the 1080 ti now, or will the price drop even further?  
I can wait till the end of September with the purchase (not a day longer though), so is there a chance that the newest Nvidia GPUs will be better than 1080 Ti? I heard about 8% improvement and only 8 GB of VRAM - in this case, the 11 GB of 1080Ti is a better fit for machine learning.

The cheapest I've seen is $629 for a 1080Ti here: [https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1330063-REG/evga\_11g\_p4\_6593\_kr\_geforce\_gtx\_1080\_ti.html](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1330063-REG/evga_11g_p4_6593_kr_geforce_gtx_1080_ti.html)"

nvidia,voodoovibe,4,1,"Regarding Dual 1080p 60hz setup...Hi. I haven't been able to find any concrete suggestions on this and so I've come here. 

The following is my current setup:

* Ryzen 7 1700

* 16GB Ram
* RX560 Video Card
* 2x 1080p 60hz monitors

I would like to play some games with ultra settings at 1080p, and do not have any immediate plans on getting 144hz monitors. 

While I know that the GTX1080 may be overkill in general for my gaming selection (which is simple 2 dimensional games and the occasional GTA), I was wondering whether there is something detrimental to obtaining a GTX1080 for my day to day computing.

*The reason I ask, is that I have an acquaintance that is offering his GTX1080SC to me, when he is supposedly moving on to the newer gpu platforms that may come out later this year.*

nvidia,Auslawthrowaway456,9,0,"[Australia] Availability and price of the 1180? I need a new card asap.My Gtx 780 died after 5 years of loyal service and I'm in need of a new card.

From historical experience, do any Australians know how available and costly (~$1100?) the 1080 was when it was released? Also, do retailers normally drop the prices on the older versions to clear them out?

I assume that I would have to wait a pretty long time to have a chance at a reasonably priced 1180 in Australia. As such, I plan to snag a 1080/1080ti when they officially announce/release the 1180.

Would greatly appreciate any advice or opinions on the matter!

nvidia,Domize,18,3,"Upgrade from 570GTX to 10/1160 GTX?So, I'm looking to upgrade my fairly ancient GPU for some casual gaming (mostly in prep for WoW's new expansion, but want to play some other games I've been unable to try).

My current rig from about 2011 is:

Evga 570 GTX

i5 2500k (OC'ed a bit, to 4 Ghz or so but can't remember exactly)

8GB RAM (DDR3 1600Mhz I think)

and a couple of SSDs.

I only play at 1080p, usually with a second monitor plugged in for a web browser. So, I was considering a 1060 GTX since it's fairly reasonable for my budget (max £250-300), however I'm now hearing all about this 11xx series. 

Is it worth waiting for the next-gen? Do we have any idea when the 1160 will come out after they announce it? I won't be able to afford a newly launched 1170/80, so would probably have to wait for the 1160 anyways. Or should I look into a used 1070 GTX?

Obviously I don't update my rig very often - but wouldn't mind the new card to last me a couple years at least. I'm also not really looking to upgrade all the rest of my rig yet as that'll be a much bigger plunge.

What do you guys think? Wait it out and play WoW on lower settings, or just go for it? "

Mobo: Asus Strix Z370-E Gaming
RAM: 32GB (3200MHz)
Storage: Samsung SSD 860 Evo 1TB

Right now I am looking for a good 3 monitor set-up in which i can work and multi-task like a boss but would also want to use the monitor in the middle for gaming. I personally wouldn't like to use all 3 monitors at the same time for gaming just the one in the middle, while still having the other 2 monitors usable (web browsing, YouTube, discord, etc). In addition I would like to mount these 3 monitors on their own monitor arm so I can adjust them whenever I want since I have a standing desk from autonomous ai. Also, it is worth mentioning that I would like all 3 monitors to have the same base resolution (1440p or 4k).

What I am looking for here is a happy medium, would like really good graphics and textures without sacrificing a lot of FPS. I was looking at 1440p 144hz G-sync monitors and read some stuff in this reddit that these monitors are the happy medium atm but would like a second opinion on that. As you can see from my current specs, price is not an issue but wouldn't want to spend more than $1,500 in all 3 monitors. 

What monitors (arm mountable) do you guys suggest? And what GPU should I get, should I get the 1080Ti or wait for the 1180/2080?

nvidia,iamanaccident,25,2,"The Future of the eGPU MarketSo a little backstory first here.

I recently sold my gaming 17 inch gaming laptop and bought myself an ultra book, the Lenovo Yoga 920 to be exact, because I'll be starting university soon and there's no way I'm gonna be bringing a 17 inch laptop around with me. Also because I've stopped gaming recently, so I don't really need a high end dedicated graphics card anymore.

However, I might just get back into casual gaming in the next few years or so, and I thought an eGPU would be perfect for my needs... Until I looked at eGPU enclosure prices. After doing a little bit of research, I found out eGPU enclosures are VERY expensive. They go for about $300 on average, and that's of course excluding the graphics card itself. After researching into the subject even further, I found 2 main reasons why they're so expensive. One is Intel's licensing fee for using Thunderbolt 3 technology and the second is the fact that the eGPU market is a very niche one. Same reasons why Thunderbolt 3 docks are expensive as well.

I don't actually need an eGPU right now, so this doesn't really concern me too much yet. This made me wonder how the whole market will turn out in a couple years, which is probably when I'll decide to get an eGPU. What do you guys think about all this? Will eGPU enclosures get cheaper any time soon? Will the demand for it increase in the next few years?

TL;DR - eGPU enclosures are very expensive due to Intel's licensing fee and it being in a niche market. Do you guys think this will change any time soon? Will it get any cheaper? Why?"

Currently, I'm running Fortnite settings on low, with the exception of view distance.    I've notice that pro gamers mostly seem to run their settings on low with the exception of view distance and textures, even when running beefy setups with 1080ti.   The lower settings don't seem to affect gameplay. 

My frame rate counter is usually pinned at 144hz though I see it drop when there is more action.  I rarely see it drop below 100, though to be honest I don't look at it at all when there is intense action, so it might go lower.  

I'm not running any other games right now.  My question:   Is there really any perceptible benefit I'd see if I were to upgrade to a 1080/1080ti/1180?   Or will I see imperceptible difference?   "

nvidia,rct0114,23,4,"Best card for scientific computation?I'm looking for a good GPU for scientific computing (bioinformatics), but it's kind of hard to decide between them. My budget is limited to $1,100. The choices were narrowed down to:

Titan Xp or GTX1080ti - I can get a good deal on a used Titan Xp, but GTX1080ti is way cheaper. 11-12GB GDDR5X is also nice. However, I'm not sure if the lack of ECC support matters in my applications.

Quadro P4000 - looks like a good choice since it is a Pascal card with ECC VRAM. But that's at the cost of reduced CUDA cores. The single PCIE slot leaves room for future expansion too.

Tesla K80 - used cards are cheaper. Tons of CUDA cores and VRAM but I might spend more for a watercooling block since there are two GPU cores in a single card. Might be difficult to manage temps without watercooling.

Vega FE liquid cooled - recent benchmarks show remarkable performance in workstations. The extra 16GB HBM2 is also good for productivity related tasks. Downside is, Vega cards are power hogs.

Honestly, I'm leaning towards Nvidia due to CUDA support, but the Vega from Radeon seems like a good choice too.

I have a bit old system :  
\-FX 8350 @ 4,4 GHz

\-GTX 750 1GB

\-8GB RAM @1333 MHz

\-MSI 970 gaming

\-sharkoon WPM500 v2

So I normally play 2 games: Rocket League and Fortnite, because nothing else that I like runs on this PC (newer AAA titles for example I tried Forza Horizon 3 demo to see how it runs. I pretty much expected 17 FPS on low setting @ 720p) 

Recently I've tried OC-ing my CPU to higher frequencies just to see how high I can go with my MOBO (it's supposed to be bad for OC-ing). I got to 4,7 GHz and following with trying to even turn on back my PC. So I reset my BIOS and everything worked fine, except when I opened up Rocket League. The game ran worse than normal but still acceptable for a couple of minutes before going completely nuts with FPS drops. It was unplayable.  
So I thought to myself, maybe it's the CPU because I normally played on 4,4 GHz instead of stock 4,0 GHz. I went to BIOS and OC it back to 4,4. When I opened up Rocket League it seemed at first as if the problem was fixed, seeing more stable FPS but again after a few minutes It started stuttering/frame dropping again. I never experienced this kind of shitty performance in the past. I have 1777 hrs on RL with this exact PC. 

I gave up and tried playing Fortnite and got the same results. Game run solid 60 FPS on 75&amp;#37; GPU usage, but after a couple of minutes it just caped to 100&amp;#37; even in the main menu (was monitoring my tasks on a second monitor). I started thinking my GPU was somehow thermal throttling. I realized I was wrong after using HW monitor to see a stable 40°C on load. But then when I alt+tab-ed and got back to the game I again saw solid 60 FPS. I thought everything was fixed, instead it wasn't, It went to lagging in a few minutes. I alt+tab-ed again and the FPS got to solid 60 AGAIN following with the same problem.

I've tried updating my drivers, I've tried reinstalling the games, I've got to the point where i reinstalled the entire windows and deleting EVERYTHING on both my SSD and HDD and just installing the drivers and games to see if anything changed. NOTHING. The GPU is still struggling to run a game normally more then 5-7 min.

With FreeSync becoming more and more widespread in PC displays and TVs and the really awful selection of G-Sync displays how big are chances NVidia will support HDMI VRR? They could keep G-Sync as premium solution if it's as supperior as they make it seem and support VRR as a basic feature.

I am playing a game, i am sure a lot of you are aware of, called PUBG.  


Poorly games like PUBG, that demand so much CPU performance in a lot of cases, will start microstuttering and underperforming and lagging all over the place, to an unplayable ammount, if there is even a little something going wrong with your system. If your CPU is acting up even a little bit, due to some bad driver or a weird background app, games like PUBG will make sure to make you feel it, when you are playing them at a 144hz, 1ms monitor, with 400DPI and 1000Hz Mouse Polling rate.  


Something will constantly feel wrong..  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


**So, let's get to the point, by starting off with my rig:**  


\- i5 8600k OC'ed @4.7GHz, temps \~60-70° when gaming/ 70-80° when stress testing, benchmarking.

\-MSI Z370 Pro Carbon Motherboard, latest BIOS(not the beta one for the new 9000 CPU series, that came out yesterday)

\- 16gb(2x8, in dual channel mode) DDR4 @3000MHz with X.M.P 1 , Corsair

\- Samsung 850 Evo 250gb SSD + 2TB Western Digital Black + 3TB Toshiba 7200RPM for storage

\- Gigabyte GTX970 G1 Gaming

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  


So here is what happened, about a month ago, i had tested my CPU performance with Cinebench and i scored 1146 Points.  


Since then, i've updated my nvidia Drivers and although i haven't been playing a lot of PUBG lately, due to it being in a horrible state at the momment, i decided to play yesterday and ohh my god was it lagging all over the place, it felt like my old 6600k @4.5GHz.  


So i run another Cinebench R15 benchmark and well, my CPU scored 1070 points! That is insane, it's as if i downclocked it by 200-300MHz or smth.  


So after messing around and uninstalling a bunch of other new drivers, like the new Realtek Audio ones etc. AFter messing around with my overclock, i couldn't fix it. Until i used DDU(Display Driver Uninstaller) and performed a clean install of the previous nvidia drivers and what do ya know... my Score is now even higher than before, at 1155, with the exact same overclock...  


PUBG is buttery smooth ever since... Won't drop below 110 FPS...

Is such a thing possible to do universally without directly implementing it into a game? It just seems like it'd be a really good thing to have because it'd help with playing at effectively higher resolutions, and not sticking to a lower resolution and having unused GPu power.

I know that at least AMD had driver support for things like supersampling, fps capping, and GPu usage monitoring, so I would have thought maybe it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to combine some of that into something like dynamic supersampling for a given fps cap.

Hi,

Your support request was escalated to me for further review. After reading through the history I don't think I am going to be able to help you here.

The warranty on these GPUs is not transferable and it looks like the purchase was made from a reseller on the Amazon website.  The warranty is only valid for the original purchaser of the GPU.

nvidia,Bearodynamics,79,53,"4th time shipping card to Asus rma in 3 monthMy experience with ASUS’s RMA team and trying to get an issue resolved 

Beginning the week before May 20th, I ran into an issue with my ASUS ROG Strix GTX 1060 O6G version. While playing Rainbow Six Siege, my display suddenly failed and my fans spun extremely fast, also resulting in a black screen. I could still hear all audio and communicate with my teammate over discord. I did as much trouble shooting as I could, checking my cables, re-installing my gpu, checking my psu, and checking my drivers. Everything seemed fine. The only issue was with the card itself it seemed. 

I called into ASUS support and got an RMA to get the card sent in and tested. I ended up having to buy two shipping labels. The first one I got I couldn’t print because of an issue with my printer. So of course I buy a second one, since the first one was an issue on my end. But after buying the second label, I waited a week without getting anything. And it took another week for me to explain to the RMA team why I needed a second label, which also meant I got bounced around to 3 or so different technicians in which I said the same thing more or less to each one. Finally, they refunded my second label, and sent me a reprint for my first so I could send the card out. Things only got worse from there. 

The card finally got to ASUS on June 12th. According to the RMA ticket and the form I had received, all that was done was confirm the problem existed and there wasn’t much they could do other than send me a replacement, which was fine. I understood why. I would have liked if they could have maybe told me why it happened and how I could prevent it, but maybe it was just a bad card. 

So they shipped out the replacement on the 14th, which I received around the 15th or 16th. I installed it, booted up my pc, and all seemed to be fine. For about 24 hours. At that point it happened again. Same issue. This brought the idea that maybe it was just a compatibility issue. So I called back in, and the technician I spoke to at that point assured me that it would probably be best to just change out the model. I was also told that the difference in price for my card and whatever replacement model I would receive would be made up for. Either of equal or greater value. Wonderful, I thought. So I got a free label, and sent the card back in. 

 But after they received it on the 21st of June, they sent another shipment the next day. Strange, shouldn’t there have been a bit more of a gap in time? Shouldn’t I have received some kind of communication to choose a different model? Well I would have, if that is what they had done. Instead, all they did was send me the exact same model card back to me. I received it a few days later and tested it again. Exact same issue. And again, no notes as to what was done. Just that the issue existed and they replaced the card. 

So of course I sent it back. Again. For the third time. This time, after getting bounced around to different techs and having this escalated to level 2 then to level 3, my RMA was finally made into a multiple RMA with the level 3 people telling that this would in fact be a model change. So imagine my surprise when after sending in my card for a third time ,receiving multiple calls about my ticket, and being reassured with each call that this is in fact a model change RMA, they sent me the exact same model card two days after receiving it. 

After calling in to ask what happened and why this was being done in this way, they essentially told me they don’t know what happened, and that they need me to send in the card again. For the fourth time. No shipping label was provided to me either. No email was sent to me about my current RMA being updated or a new one being made. And while I was on the phone with another technician, because the first one I had spoken to about why I was getting the same model back hung up on me, they told me that before anything could be done, even just checking what their inventory was for me to pre-select a different model, they need me to send the card back. Again.

I received the card today, and had to call in to have them make a RMA and have a shipping label sent to me to fix their mistake. I am not sending another thing back to them again if this also gets messed up. 

So after three months of dealing with this issue, I am beyond frustrated with the entire thing. I can’t get a refund of any sort, and I’ve lost money on this trying to get this all sorted out. 

This is the last time I deal with ASUS. "

* MSI Z97S SLI Krait edition
* 620W SeaSonic power supply
* EVGA GTX 980

I own a 1440p 144hz monitor so the intention is mainly for 1440p gaming, not 4k as of yet since they don't have any 144hz monitors.

so ever since I have that GTX1080 I have an issue with the driver.

nvidia,Salersen,0,2,"[NEED ADVICE] Problem with 2 monitor setup on different refresh rates.**My setup:**
* NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti Strix
* Intel i7 8700k @ 4.5 GHz
* 16 GB RAM DDR4 Dominator @3200 MHz
* 1st Monitor - BENQ ZOWIE XL2411P @144 Hz
* 2nd Monitor - LG FLATRON IPS235 @60 Hz
* Windows 10 PRO ORG
--------------------

I use 1st monitor for gaming for obvious reasons, and 2nd monitor for browsing and applications since it has better color. Apps like Teamspeak, Battlenet, Steam, OBS, etc etc. 

I play some video games on borderless, some on fullscreen but the problem occurs in both ways.

**Problem:** When I'm in game on 1st monitor and have an app on 2nd monitor open i.e. teamspeak, my refresh rate on 1st drops to 60 fps despite showing it runs over 150+ fps. I can have chrome open (disabled acceleration) on fullscreen and i still have 144hz on main monitor, no matter the content showing in browser. 
But, if there is an application under the chrome open (no matter the size of its window) my refresh rate drops to 60hz. So, I have to literally minimize that app that is under the browser and everything goes back to normal with the refresh rates. 
It is not a big problem but it kinda messes with my ability to stream games, since I have to minimize my OBS aswell and that means that I can't track my bitrates and all the stuff. 

And I just want to know if there is anything I can make to force 144hz at all times? 

I can provide screenshots of my nvidia control panel. (everything is checked in there to force 144hz) 

I read somewhere that there is a bug between NVIDIA and WIN 10 that impacts this particular problem with refresh rates. And some even say that I should use 120hz instead, but I don't want that since I bought a 144hz monitor for the obvious reason. 

Any suggestion are welcome. 

Thank you in advance.

nvidia,jdon1218,1,1,"NVIDIA Shield buffering issues from flash drive?Hi all, I just purchased a Vero 4k to play a large HEVC file (about 95GB) from a USB flash drive.

nvidia,mtichbon86,15,0,"Do I need a full rebuild for 4K?A few years ago I moved on from my Xbox 360 and built my first gaming PC on a mini ITX mobo.

It upscales well enough from 1080p but I'd like to spec in a new GPU to hit native 4K.

My question is in two parts: 1) What's a decent GPU to get?  Am thinking either a 980ti or a 1080 (not ti). 2) Do I need to respec my CPU, which is currently still the original i5 4570?  If I do, that will mean a new mobo and probably DDR4 RAM as well.

I'm not looking for the best - can't afford the best as I don't have an unlimited budget (1080 ti is well out!). I was nearly tempted by the Xbox One X when that launched, especially so I could get back into Halo and would be cheaper than building a whole new PC if the CPU was going to be a bottleneck.

The first hint can be easily translated into HDMI 2.1 - because all current nVidia cards come already with DisplayPort 1.4. The second hint _can be_ pointed to the return of hotclocks (like nVidia's Fermi generation). The third hint will just mean that there is more gain than usually expect from the 12nm process - so, a performance gain higher than 20-30%. But it's still unclear, if +40% or +70% are incoming with nVidia's Turing.

nvidia,DeathKoil,2,2,"At my wit's end: G-Sync Windowed Borderless and low FPS.PC stats: i7 7700K @ 4.8Ghz, eVGA 1080 SC, previously had an eVGA 1070 FTW but got the 1080 SC sent to me when I RMA'd the 1070 for a bad fan, 16GB 3200mhz Corsair memory, and Samsung 960 Evo.

I've been having an issue since my machine was updated to Windows 10 1607. That update broke G\-Sync in windowed or borderless windowed mode, which is how I play my games. What happens is that about 30&amp;#37; of the time you load into a game or transition from a loading screen into a game, you will get stuck at 18\-22 FPS. If you make the window the game is running in lose focus by hitting alt\+tab, the windows key, or clicking out of the window if it's not fullscreen, the problem will be instantly fixed.

It's been a year and I've tried everything! Recently, in a comments section on /r/buildapc, a redditor and I were talking about this and he said he found that the GPU gets throttled by something until you make that application lose focus, so I decided to test this.

I started logging in HFInfo64, launched Heroes of the storm, hopped into a custom game with just me there. 20fps! I left it there for a minute or two then hit alt/tab. FPS jumped over 144. I then alt tabbed out to stop the logging.

During the time that I was stuck at 20fps the GPU was performing as follows:

* **GPU Voltage** .85 volts
* **GPU Wattage** 45\-50 watts 
* **GPU Clock** 1227mhz
* **GPU Load** 6\-8&amp;#37;
* **GPU Performance Limit \[Utilization\]** Yes
* **FPS** 18\-22

As soon as I hit Alt/Tab to make Heroes of the Storm lose focus, the GPU voltage went up and I got to 144\+FPS instantly.

* **GPU Voltage** 1.063 volts
* **GPU Wattage** 135\-145 watts 
* **GPU Clock** 1987mhz
* **GPU Load** 40\-50&amp;#37;
* **GPU Performance Limit \[Utilization\]** No
* **FPS** 144

This test was done with ""Power Management Mode"" set to ""Optimal Power"" (which is the default) in the nVidia Control Panel. I then switched it to ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" and there was no change. I ran a test and had the exact same outcome on my first try. Next, I left the nVidia Control Panel on ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" and went into the power settings and changed ""PCI Express Link State Power Management to Off (default is ""Moderate Power Savings""). This shouldn't be the culprit as this setting only affects how long it takes to ramp up a PCIe device. As I suspected, this did not fix the issue either. It took three more tries but the GPU did do it's ""low power low FPS"" thing. I also went into the BIOS and checked all of the PCIe power settings, and all are disabled so the card is not getting stuck in parked mode. 

Additionally, I have tried the following:

* A dozen or so nVidia drivers over the last year\+
* A few full wipes of the system only installing the latest nVidia driver and a single game before testing and seeing that the issue does still exist
* Turn off Xbox DVR
* Turn off Game Bar
* Turn off Game Mode (registry key)
* Turn off Fast Startup
* Set Power Management Mode to ""Prefer Maximum Performance"" in the nVidia Control Panel
* Set PCIe Power Link Management to ""Off"" in the Windows power settings
* Kill wdm.exe after the machine starts and restarting it
* Ensure all PCIe power management is turned off in the BIOS
* Turn on/off Full Screen Optimizations for the game executables
* Updating the BIOS for my motherboard (twice)

Something limiting the power of the card until you make the application in question lose focus (alt\+tab, hit the windows key, etc), then the GPU power immediately increases! This does not occur when G\-Sync is off, or when G\-Sync is on and you are playing Fullscreen. It only occurs about 20&amp;#37; of the time you are playing in Windowed or Borderless Windowed mode and have just started a game or are transition from a loading screen.

There are several threads on the nVidia forums showing hundreds of others have the issue, but currently there are no answers. I have posted my data there showing the card is not properly ramping up and is being limited by something, but those comments didn't gain any traction, so I'm trying here.

Can anyone help? Can anyone think of another test or tests I can run to narrow down why the card isn't ramping up properly? It's been over a year with no fix and I am so sick of having to alt tab out what I'm playing after every loading screen. Thank you!"

I've owned a PNY GTX 1060 6GB for about 1.5 years. In the last 6 months it has begun acting out. It will blink a display randomly (every r(1,20) minutes) if two are plugged in. Display doesn't lose signal, but the screen goes black for just 2 seconds and then returns to normal. I have used different monitor combinations, TV's, resolutions, cables, ports, OS's (ubuntu, Windows) all combinations you can think of over the last 6 months. I've used DVI, HDMI, Displayport. I've bought all of the fancy cables I could muster \- as short as my setup would allow (5'). I've done BIOS updates, hardware troubleshooting, changed PCI Xpress ports. I checked out all the pins in the PCI slot and on the card. Everything short of buying a new motherboard (D3H Z77) or PSU (Calculated wattage \- no issues at all. Changed 6\-pin sources too). I've recently settled on the fact that this Nvidia card only actually supports one display (if only one \- doesnt matter what resolution or port \- it works fine). I have plugged in my 960 GTX with 0 issues.

I bought it brand new from Fry's Electronics. They can't lookup the receipt and of course I don't even have the bank account I used to purchase the video card. Nvidia did not help. PNY walked me through everything I had already done \- and then finally asked for a receipt. I can't even get the receipt. I'm super bummed seeing how GPU's doubled in price  (I see they're going back down to normal retail).

I know there is already an open thread about this subject, but I'm new here and I didn't manage to reply there.

Here's my problem.
I have a Gigabyte P35x V6. It's supposed to be a beast, even if it's just a laptop, but here's what happens when I run Userbenchmark, with no CPU usage at all, laptop pluged in, max performance settings on, all latest drivers installed.

http://www.userbenchmark.com/UserRun/9217177

As u see, everything works above expectations but gpu.

The only thing I can guess is that my laptop has been to assistance a few times for goddamn ssd issues, but the first time they even change the fan system, which got broken as well. Is it possibile that they limited the power to gpu in order to prevent further damage to the fan system?
But again just a few days ago, right after my laptop came back from latest (and I hope last) assistance, I made a full and through reset of it, and than installed again all the latest stuff as I said. Now it's supposed to be a brand new laptop.

What do you think?

nvidia,TrojanLeHorse,1,1,"GTX 1070 Founder's Edition fan anomalySo I woke up this morning and noticed that my Founder's Edition 1070's fan was running a lot louder than usual (and I run it on 100&amp;#37; a lot of the time, due to mining on it on most nights, while I sleep). Upon checking MSI Afterburner, I found that the temp was much cooler than usual (57C was the max for the entire time, and it usually sits within the 64\-66C range under the same load), but the Fan Tachometer was also registering \~5200 RPM on the fan. Recollecting on it, I don't think I'd EVER seen the fan go that fast, so I rebooted my PC (because I was unable to slow it down without doing that) and then checked the fan tachometer reading at 100&amp;#37; fan speed. It maxed out at around 4000 RPM, which is consistent with how I've seen it perform since I first bought it. Was this a one\-time (or anomalous) bug, or has my card just not been actually giving me ""100&amp;#37; fan speed"" since I bought it. Because the sound and noise after the reboot was the same as its always been, but when it bugged to \~5200 RPM it was an entirely different breed."

In World of Warcraft I am getting 70 FPS when I used to get like 120 FPS. Counter Strike I get 100 FPS when I used to get like 180 FPS. On top of that, if I have youtube playing in the background now it would cause all games FPS to tank to around 30-40 FPS causing crazy stuttering.

I did a little research and turned off the hardware acceleration in Chrome and it sort of fixed the problem too which lets me view them in 1080p.

nvidia,rexusjrg,0,1,"NVIDIA driver issue since 397.31 or just my PC dying?Tried to post on the driver issue thread but seems like my comment is just getting buried. So, I made a separate post on this issue.

Has anybody experienced slowdowns on startup on Win10 1803 since 397.31? When I start my PC, the Windows chime does not sound and other startup programs won't load in the notifications area other than the NVCP. The mouse responds OK but, if I hover on the taskbar, I get the loading circle in Win10. The start button also won't respond as quickly and I cannot restart or shutdown the PC. Even if I do get the PC to restart or shutdown, the problem persists.

The way I circumvent this is turning off the power supply and going into BIOS. Without changing anything, I just exit out of the BIOS then, immediately after Win10 loads, the chime sounds and everything works fine.

Driver seems stable for me and seems smoother than previous ones. I just have the issue I stated here and need that one extra step to make my PC run as expected.

nvidia,Mentiqq,2,1,"Spare account or key for Geforce NowHello r/nvidia

I am living in a dorm with 6 roomates and i have very bad computer. Gaming is my favorite free time spending activity since i was a small child and now i live in a dorm so i don't have that option anymore , and every time I just don't feel like listening to my roomates shouting and stuff like that, I feel like I would just want to play something. My pc is very bad and i can barely run any games on it, and we are not planning on spending $400 laptop that could actually run games on low.
For example i can play Fortnite on the lowest settings possible with about 20 fps, with unacceptable input lag and on a resolution that is around 480p (sorry I can't recall) . I've tried running older games on it and those are performing bad aswell. I have a fast cellular data connection on my phone so internet speed wouldn't be a problem for me. I'd love to play some games in my freetime because those are what make this place feel like im at home.
Usually I have a lot of classes a day and I spend most of my time studying but when I have the time I always enjoy some gaming.

I have signed up for Gerforce Now but I feel like it will take forever for me to get a key.

Geforce Now would be the perfect solution for me.
If any of you have a spare account or a key that i could use sometimes then that would be highly appreciated.
I believe that there are some of you (or someone you know) who have signed up for the beta for fun (or have never actually used it) and would be kind enough to share with someone who needs it a lot.

Thank you very much
have a great day"

1) Can I use graphics card desktop grade GPUs or mobile GPUs?

2) Can I use superior graphics card like 1070 ,1080 or do I have to use 1060 or below?

3) Can I use Quadro as eGPU with GTX 1060 or do I have to stick with GeForce?

nvidia,AlphaInit,4,1,"Petition: HardwareID Bans for CheatersHello nVidia,

I'd love to see you work with game developers to create a global ban list for confirmed cheaters, based on HardwareID/physical hardware.

Right now, cheaters use stolen Creditcards to get dirt-cheap copies of games, so when their game account is banned they can keep cheating for another $5. This encourages creditcard fraud/theft.

If you install cheats and are 100% confirmed to be running cheats in an online game, there needs to be a global ban put on that physical machine, that will prevent it from ever joining any online game that participates in the ban list.

Used hardware sold on ebay could get unbanned with proof of purchace and government issued ID. Anyone who purchaces cheat-banned hardware, gets it unbanned, and then cheats on that hardware, would be put on another blacklist and not be allowed to have cheater hardware unbanned ever again.

To anyone who says this is unfair, it isnt. You're not required to buy any games that support this anticheat feature. And the rest of us are sick of your cheats."

nvidia,jaykresge,182,133,"Ballparking GTX 11-series performance | Using actual statistics for a reasonable result | And some pricing speculationA fairly recent post over at WTFTech (a bastion of reliability, I know) estimated a MASSIVE performance leap generation over generation for the GF 11-series. This showed the GTX 1170 nearly on par with the 1080ti, and the GTX 1180 decimating the 1080ti. Basically, it looked like they cloned the GF 9 to 10 series comparison charts.

It would be foolish to assume that we'd see the same performance gains. Maxwell to Pascal was a shrink over 2 nodes and we're not likely to see that kind of leap here. While supposedly going from 16nm to 12nm, my understanding is that it's the same actual size, just a more refined process. To get a better idea of the performance gains that we can expect, let's take a look at the last few generations where this occurred.

##Fermi

The GeForce 400 and 500 series were both on the 40nm process. The GTX 580 saw a performance gain of 13% over the GTX 480. [(SOURCE)] (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/ASUS/GeForce_GTX_570/27.html) The 470 to 570 comparison from that chart isn't apples to apples as it's reference to aftermarket.

##Kepler and Maxwell

The GeForce 600, 700, and 900 series were all on the 28nm process (except some rebadges that remained on 40nm). Let's see how the top cards did between generations here.

Note: I'm using the ""all resolutions"" chart when provided. When not used (more recent reviews), I'm using the mid-resolution (2560x1600 or 2560x1440) chart. Also, I'm using the slower card as the base. So, if Card A is 84%, and Card B is 100%, then Card B is 19% faster (16% difference / 84% base).

* GTX 680 was 19% faster than the GTX 580, despite being on a new process. [(SOURCE)] (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_680/27.html)
* GTX 780 was 19% faster than the GTX 680, while on the same process. [(SOURCE)] (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_780/26.html)
* The GTX 980 was 30% faster than the GTX 780, despite being on the same process. [SOURCE] (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_980/26.html)
* The GTX 980ti was 40% faster than the GTX 780ti. [(SOURCE)] (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_980_Ti/31.html)

##Pascal

And just to have the full pictures, Pascal's numbers.

* The GTX 1080 was 67% faster than the GTX 980. [(SOURCE)] (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_1080/26.html)
* The GTX 1080ti was 75% faster than the GTX 980ti. [(SOURCE)] (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GeForce_GTX_1080_Ti/30.html)

That's an amazing jump, but again, it's largely the result of skipping a process.

##Projecting the GeForce 11-Series

First, what do we know? We are guessing that the process is actually the same size. Also, we're guessing that we're moving away from Maxwell/Pascal to a new architecture. So, what transition from the data above looks closest to this?

Fermi to Fermi was the same architecture on the same process, so that's out. Same with Kepler to Kepler. Maxwell to Pascal was a new architecture on a VERY new node, so that's out. But Kepler to Maxwell looks like a winner - new architecture on the same but refined process. Let's use that as a base. With the 980 seeing a 30% uplift over its predecessor, and the 980ti seeing a 40% bump, I went with 35%. I then extrapolated this for the potential GTX 1160, 1170, and 1180 (traditionally the first products to lauch, x50 and x80ti/Titan products can be extrapolated off those AFTER they launch). I then put these into the TPU 1440p 1080ti charts just to see how they would line up.

I am NOT a Photoshop pro, so please forgive the quality (and it was done in MS Paint) - https://i.imgur.com/gyk4jd9.png

From here I think we get a VERY reasonable projection.

* The GTX 1160 should offer ~1070 performance, with 1060 power draw, and IDEALLY, the 1060 price point (more on this later).
* The GTX 1170 should offer ~1080 performance, 1070 power draw.
* The GTX 1180 should offer ~1080ti performance, 1080 power draw.

##Pricing, the real hold up

And I think this is WHY Nvidia has been reluctant to announce/launch. Let's look at launch pricing (not the price drops after 1080ti launch):

* 960 ($199/$229) to 1060 ($199/$249, $299 FE)
* 970 ($329) to 1070 ($379, $449 FE)
* 980 ($549) to 1080 ($599, $699 FE)

Silicon wafer prices have supposedly increased by 20% year over year. Memory pricing is INSANE. What seemed outlandish in 2017 ($299 for a 1060 FE? LOL!) is now a bargain! But the 1080ti gives us an idea of where they're going - MSRP and FE price were identical. Nvidia may try to use the FE price as the base MSRP this time, and the elevated FE pricing last time would make the new base MSRP more acceptable (so long as you block out the 900-series pricing). We could end up with:

* GTX 1160 = $299 (with a cheaper, cut-down and lower memory variant in the $229-$249 ballpark))
* GTX 1170 = $449
* GTX 1180 = $649

But here's the problem. Most AIBs have jacked their MSRPs above that for current-gen hardware. If Nvidia were to launch today, even those elevated prices above might be difficult to reach. The 1160 might have to be $349. And after selling an x60 variant at $199 since the x60's inception, selling the new x60 over $300 is a tough pill even for Nvidia to swallow.

##Conclusion

Nvidia has likely had hardware ready to go for awhile now. Waiting 2 years to release a new product cycle is out of form (but not unheard of) for them. My best guess is that the modest performance gains on a similar sized node combined with today's pricing reality makes a new launch a bit tough for them. The price-to-perf ratio barely moves.

They're likely waiting for memory prices to drop, or if that doesn't happen, maybe they do wait until 2019 when 7nm can give them a larger performance gain to justify the price increase."

So I expected how it will be truly something! But here comes my confusion. When i installed monitor, first thing i did was enable gsync for fullscreen in NVIDIA settings and 144 Hz as Well. Then played GTA 5, witcher 3 etc. and it was good, but it wasnt smooth event with high fps. 

So in NVIDIA settings enabled gsync for fullscreen and eindowed screen and lol, IT was so smooth that i had nausea (really). Then day later installed newest drivers and hey, i have a feeling that gsync work no more, no smoothness (no nausea). I limitrd FPS via rtss to 140fps, disabled vsync ingame and enable via nvsetting.

GPU: 2xGTX 970 EVGA SLI

These cards have only been used for gaming and no OC'ing has been done on any of my hardware.

It's really when im playing games such as BF1, FORTNITE, PUBG - Both GPUs are at a constant 100% usage and fans are blasting. So here's my question, should I upgrade to an 1080 and sell both 970 (already have people wanting to buy them for 260$ CAD each) or should I wait.

PS: Will waiting and playing said games that pushes my GPU to 100% ''injure'' the card if I keep playing them? 

P.P.S: I also read online (might be totally irrelevant) people who havea 144hz screen and 60 hz screen attached to the same GPU in SLI are finding problems with the heating/usage of their GPU."

nvidia,worthwhale,55,8,"GTX 1180 - upgrade my rig or start from scratch?First of all, I know that nothing has been released about this GPU yet, but let's assume it's a fairly predictable, status quo update (the thermals and size aren't radically different to a 1080ti, let's say).

So if we go with that assumption, I was wondering what more experienced builders make of my current situation: I have a 980 stuck inside a tiny [Cooler Master Elite 130](http://www.coolermaster.com/case/mini-itx-elite-series/elite130). It uses a H97i Plus motherboard (limits me to DDR3), and an i5-4690K.

Basically, I'm wondering what people's best guess would be as far as having a rig that isn't necessarily the best in the world, but isn't letting down a high end GPU like a 1080ti or a hypothetical 1180, especially for 4K - and by extension, whether I should upgrade the existing or start from scratch. To my mind, the big questions are:

* is sticking a card like that in a tiny chassis with just a fan or two really that bad? The 980 has been going fine for 3 years now.

* is the i5-4690K going to constrain me? It's a bit long in the tooth, but anecdotally I've heard people saying that at 4K the high-end GPUs seem to carry the processor a lot.

* RAM: should I upgrade to DDR4? Obviously will have to swap motherboard if so.

A shop I know sells the Galax GTX1080 EXOC Sniper for 570€, which doesn't seem like a bad price for me, considering it's just 20€ above MSRP, but with a custom board, cooler etc.
From what I heard, the EXOC also has a pretty good overclock margin.

I know the GTX11xx series will probably be available by September/October, but:

* The GTX1180, according to many rumors, will probably cost around 699€, so it'd be out of range for me anyways
* A GTX1170, supposing it'll be available for about the same price as that EXOC now, with an aftermarket version (which is not guaranteed for all we know) shouldn't be more than 10-15% faster than a GTX1080 anyways, right?

I mean, I need to get this new rig soon anyways, but I'm thinking whether it would be worth it to hold on for another 6 months to get a GTX1170, or if all things considered, a GTX1080 EXOC for that price would still be a decent investment now.

nvidia,Gigabytes1337,81,30,"Have your games been stuttering lately?I've been battling with stuttering in games for months and really feel defeated over it. I just wanted to know if many others have been suffering with the same issue.

Basically every game stutters and hitches and BF1 is one of the worst. It happens when the standby memory cache eats up all of the free memory. Clearing it seems to reduces the frequency and intensity of the stuttering.

[Video example of the stutters](https://youtu.be/_lJcv0V4qlY?t=1m56s) (link starts at 1:56, just before a few obvious frametime spikes)

It stutters with frametime spikes in the first half of the video but when I clear the standby memory (2:21) it seems to improve though not resolve. From the MSI afterburner graph you can see the frametime spikes are less frequent and intense than before in the rest of the video (the most of the frametime spikes afterwards seem to be from the spawn screen rather than gameplay). I should note that the GPU usage in this video is low because of the low windowed resolution. I normally play at 1440p where the usage is usually 100% but still stutter.

I've had this issue for almost 9 months but can't seem to solve it. Clearing standby only helps alleviate the stuttering but it still remains and returns pretty quickly. It's worse the longer the PC has been running and in this video my PC was booted for less than an hour.

I've read pretty much every post in the [Nvidia stuttering thread](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/1004600/geforce-drivers/all-games-stuttering-with-fps-drops-since-windows-10-creators-update/231/) and sent a few tracelogs to Nvidia and Microsoft but haven't really heard anything more. I originally found the standby clear suggestion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/7a0763/standby_memory_issue_causing_stutters_on_creators/)

Have tried all the usual troubleshooting steps like reinstall windows/drivers, default settings, no 3rd party apps etc but can't seem to resolve the stuttering. Some games are worse than others, even different maps in BF1 have varying frequency of stutter (Amiens being the worst offender).

I just wondered if any of you were also having these issues. I just felt like having a bit of a moan since the stuttering has been sucking the enjoyment out of games for me. The majority of users seem fine, so I'm really curious as to what is causing this issue. Oddly games ran fine on my old 290X but since switching to a GTX 1080 I've been struggling with this issue.

Thanks for reading.

On a gtx 980 on the newest driver 391.95, I got 209 FPS average on an FPS test. On an older driver 378.49, I got an average of 247 FPS. A 18% increase when downgrading my driver. Is there any way to fix this for the newer drivers on nvidias end or is this something that I will have to live with if I upgrade my drivers to the newest version."

nvidia,leospeedleo,56,44,"[Question] Running TWO G-Sync monitors at the same timeWell...I have a question and I can't find anything for it...

My current setup is:

- AOC 1080p 144hz G-Sync Main
- Samsung 1080p 60hz NON-G-Sync Secondary

If I want to upgrade to a newer, 1440p 144hz G-Sync display, am I able to run both my new display and my old 1080p 144hz G-Sync display at the same time and play only on the main display as I do for the time being?

Or better sell the G-Sync display I'm using now instead of the Non-G-Sync one and use the 60hz one with the new one as it is currently?

I'm asking this as I can only find questions and answers regarding a G-Sync main display with a secondary non-G-Sync display as I have atm. So either:

- Sell secondary 60hz Non-G-Sync display and have 1440p 144hz G-Sync &amp; 1080p 144hz G-Sync

or

- Sell 1080p 144hz G-Sync and have 1440p 144hz G-Sync &amp; 1080p 60hz Non-G-Sync?

Thanks in advance!"

nvidia,semenboy5000,10,2,"What would be the best upgrade path for me? (Monitor upgrade vs GPU upgrade)Hello.

Right now I have a gtx 970 paired with an it 4690. I also currently have a 1080p 144hz 27 inch monitor. I have dragged my old 24 inch 60hz monitor out of the loft as I had started to hear about how 1080p at 27 inches can start to look a bit less sharp due to the larger pixels. I definitely see the difference when playing Assassin's Creed origins on my 24 inch monitor versus my 27 inch.

I did really miss my 144hz though so I began to look at 27"" 1440p (to offset the size issue) 144hz monitors with g-sync (to alleviate some of the low fps with my 970 at 1440p issues) and settled on either the Dell S2716 G-Sync monitor (or the s2417, still not decided on whether 24 inches is too small for 1440p, if anybody has any input on that it'd be much appreciated) or the Acer XB271U G-Sync. These cost around about £530 at the moment.

After seeing the price tag I saw an ad that nvidia have the GTX 1080's in stock for £530, and here is the dilemma. Is it worth getting one of these monitors when I only have a 970? Is it worth getting a GTX 1080 when I only have a 1080p 144hz screen? Is it worth getting a gpu at all at the moment seeing as new ones might be coming out soon?

I just don't know you guys...I just don't know.

EDIT: I've been playing with my 24 inch monitor now for a couple of hours and am completely used to it again. It looks so much better than the 27 incher at 1080p. I'm now just worried that 1440p on a 24 inch screen isn't worth it. Anybody compared a 24 to a 27 inch at 1440p and know much of a difference? I would go to a shop if they had any but there aren't any shops for pc stuff nearby."

I have it for 2 days but suddenly some weird sound started to come from it. After 1 hour of trying to figure it out, i found out one of the fans (near the screen ports) is making some weird mechanical sound like theres something inside or bearings are dying. Any idea what it is? It happens only when the fans start spinning no matter what speed, gets only a bit louder when at 100%, not by much tho. Also i tried to spin the fan with my hand and so on and while the middle (wasnt easy to spin) and 3rd fan are completely silent, the first one has a weird sound like it has some dust or hair or something stuck in it.

With this upgrade, I've also ordered a new monitor (the S2417DG - 1440p TN panel with 165hz refresh, won't arrive for the next week or two). Currently my system runs an i5 3330 processor and 16GBs of RAM.

My question is - Would the processor here be the one holding me back from 1440p gaming with the new monitor at 144hz, preferably at high settings (not Ultra/Epic)? I found that playing Overwatch on maxed out Epic settings my CPU runs at 99% consistently jumping between 70fps - 100fps @ 60hz 1080p"

nvidia,LeagueofSOAD,32,6,"I have two 1060s, but I messed up.I had no idea The 1060 doesn't have an SLI port to bridge them. They are a couple months old now, I just plugged them in and went on as I had no idea what I was doing. I started to wonder how come one gpu was never heating up since I downloaded this speed fan that tells me all of my hardwares temperature. I noticed that GPU1 was around 50c and GPU2 was at around 30c. So I looked into whats  up. I learnt that multiple GPUs needed to be bridged through SLI slots, so i was like ok cool. Thats when I figured out that only the 1060 doesn't support SLI because it has no ports for it. So I have been sitting here for 5 months or so with an 1060 that has not been used at all. I wasted 350$ on a GPU that just sits. What Can I do with it? Do I try to sell one of them or keep it as a back up? I could save up money, sell both 1060s and buy a 1070 or a 1080? I don't know the resale value of them."

Now I have been looking at ebay for a couple weeks now for 1070s and I have seen a few go for very decent prices, but a quite a few of them have been used for mining. Either this is stated on the item description or the seller answers as such when I ask them if the card has been heavily used like in for mining or rendering.

So my question is how much of risk is it buy a used card that has been used for mining?

For example, I currently have an eye on a 7 month old Aorus 1070, fully boxed, but the seller has said that the card was running a mining workload at standard clock frequencies and he has tested card using Unigine Heaven benchmark. So is this aorus 1070 okay to buy if I can get if for £320 or should I avoid cards like this?"

nvidia,Romeadidas,17,0,"GTX 1070 , 1070 ti or 1080 , best value for me?Hello, i'm in need of an upgrade, wont wait 6+ months for volta or whatever is coming next.

My objectives are gaming of course, right now i have an 1080p 144hz monitor (i will exchange it for an 1440p 144hz in ~3 months) and i have a 4k TV.

i plan on playing FPS and competitive games on my future 1440p 144hz monitor (keyboard + mouse), the rest playable on controller like witcher 3, tomb raider etc, on my 4k TV.

firstly i was almost buying a GTX 1080 cause right now i have an 500W PSU only, dont think i can sell it and buy a 700W whitout spending extra $ 100, plus my 1080p monitor uses DVI-D and most gtx 1080 ti dont have a dvi-d connector...

the prices where i live (cheapest options for each card): 
GTX 1070 asus dual : $ 645
GTX 1070 ti amp edition: $ 730
GTX 1080 g1 gaming : $ 880
GTX 1080 ti evga: $ 1.115,00

i plan on overclock them, i know the 1070, 1070 ti, 1080 performances differences are within overclock margin, but as i will play in 4k some games every bit of performance counts. (probably will scale down the resolution and tone down some settings to achieve 60fps)

which card you think would be the best for me in this scenario? sry for bad english.

Would this be worth it for a performance gain helping me to run these games at ultra settings or would that $100 be better saved until after the mining craze is over and I can snag 1060/1070 and start playing modern titles (fallout 4, rise of the tomb raider, witcher 3, far cry 4, etc).

nvidia,LeRoyVoss,51,1,"How do you even get a card for a fair price these days? :(Hello fellow gamers.

It has been months since I started looking for a GPU at a fair price. I'm in EU and in my country (but the situation looks the same everywhere) I cannot find a GPU at a fair price.

I do not have big needs, I am by no means rich (the very opposite, actually) and my son was born recently so I can't really afford to pay the premium to get my hands on a GPU in this situation. I'd even even settle for a GTX 1050 Ti (or 1060 possibly), just to play a couple of hours a day - with all the daily things such as work, family and such it really helps me to ""pull the plug"".

My previous GPU broke and was out of warranty, it was old and I don't think it's remotely worth to try and get it repaired if that's even possible. I enjoy light games such as indies or old RPGs and RTS games that reminds me of my childhood so I'm not looking for very powerful stuff - I'd be really happy with a low to mid tier card.

Plus Final Fantasy XV has been recently released for PC, I have been waiting for this game for 12 years now (yes, since it was announced as ""Final Fantasy Versus XIII""!). I was never able to afford or justify a console so I was really looking forward to play this game and after making some little ficial ""sacrifices"" here and there I was planning to upgrade my GPU in order to be able to play this long awaited game (for me, at least).

So I was able to put aside about €150 Euros for a new GPU, but even looking at used ones there's no luck. I could go with a GTX 1050, with some luck I think I can find it at that price, but if I spend the money I have saved I'd like to buy something a bit more durable (I think that normally you should be able to buy a used GTX 1060 with that money, let alone a 1050 Ti...). I really can't understand how the greed of a bunch of people (I hate calling out but yes, I'm talking about miners) can destroy the simple needs of other people like me :(

Sorry for the long rant. Many people will just ignore this, and it is just fine, but I wanted to ask help to this community as a last resort, maybe someone has an idea on how I can get a GPU for a fair pricing? Maybe someone has a spare GPU and is willing to sell it to me? Don't need the latest and the greatest, really. It's not even like I'm asking something for free, I could be poor but I still have dignity and would never do that :( I just ask for fairness. Thanks for reading and sorry for my grammar, English is not my mother tongue."

So I am wondering if there is a second way to run 3d on my nvidia 3d vision monitor. 
Well the first would obviously be to hook up a blu ray player inside your case. You then need power dvd I think and the nvidia glasses.

Now, this is what I am wondering about:
Can you not buy a 3d blu ray player that is made to hook up to a 3d tv and just directly connect it to your monitor without going through the computer first. You'd need regular glasses, not the nvidia ones....

Thanks for any answers."

My gripe is that in GFN, I have all the DLC for Fallout 4 installed when I don't even own any, and I can picture people getting cocked up saves if they use GFN for gaming on the go or whatever (assuming of course that this isn't just an isolated incident with me).



~~So I got into the GeForce Now beta just a couple days ago and I'm LOVING it (perfect seeing as how my 7950 died about two weeks ago and I'm using a 7570 now), but unfortunately there seems to be a bit of an annoying bug with Fallout 4.~~

~~Using GeForce Now, all of the DLC is installed and actually usable, which is great... *Other than the fact that the only DLC I ""own"" is the High-Res Texture Pack...*~~

~~Now I'm not complaining because now I realize just how badly I want to grab the season pass (and thankfully I have the old save untouched on my PC since FO4 isn't even installed to sync saves), but I imagine it could be a bit of an annoyance for people who would actually have their saves sync'd.~~"

nvidia,echostar777,15,0,"A tip for GeForce GT 1030 users looking to improve performance.Just so you know, if you have a warranty on this graphics card, it will be void, but I do have to say, this modification improves performance by a mile and can be used for other graphics cards that doesn't have thermal pads/paste applied to the memory chips, so I was playing fallout 4 with this guy and surprisingly it runs quite well with 8 gigs of RAM, but there is an issue with thermal disapation.
Now the graphics chip works just fine, it's not that specifically, it's the memory that's the issue here, I've noticed that most graphics cards, most high performance variants, have thermal pads on the memory chips to keep them from over heating, well I noticed right off the bat that the gt 1030 doesn't have any thermal paste/pads on the memory chips and after heavy usage, it gets to the point where it burns to the touch, which isn't good at all, so I did some tinkering with some thermal paste, I know it's a bit risky to use thermal paste so I recommend you use thermal pads instead. Well after applying the paste to the memory chips, my performance leveled out, fallout 4 doesn't freeze or crash anymore, Garry's mod runs at a whopping 220 fps after some modifications to the game, human fall flat works great now at nearly 60fps, resident evil 4 runs quite smoothly although the controls suck, portal 2 runs at 50 fps and hand simulator runs at about 60 fps and Terraria runs at about 50fps, keep in mind that I used GeForce experience to optimize the games for my PC but I figured I'd share this here for anyone having trouble with a graphics card, it works wonders, but I highly recommend you use thermal pads, if you don't have access to the pads, use the thermal paste at your own risk.



'Edit' I can confirm my gpu was thermal throttled, and what I did was bridge the gap between the memory chips and the heatsink. I have a small form factor PC that builds up quite a bit of heat. So considering, I would assume it's because of its poor heat disapation as well as it's size.

&gt;Are laptops such as the Acer Predator considered notebooks?

On the [Nvidia Drivers](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) page, for the product series, there is a series for notebooks and I'm assuming the other series is for regular PC's or laptops. What's the call here, are laptops simply considered notebooks?

&gt;Where's the Update tab in the Help section of the Nvidia Control panel?

I've seen a few ways to update the Nvidia Drivers, such as the way above by looking up your model, but when going to the Nvidia Control Panel on your desktop by right clicking and then going to the Help tab on the top area, is the Updates section only supposed to be there when an update is available? Or is it gone for some other reason?

&gt; Finally, if there are any Acer Predator owners out there, have you found it a absolute need to update the Nvidia drivers when you first purchase it?

I found a very comprehensive review (off of amazon) that was very indepth on not only the experience of the laptop, but it's small issue of not having the very current drivers. Was it a necessity for any of you owners to have to update it very quickly or eventually?

Thanks in advanced as I don't really have any knowledge in this area and am very conflicted as to how I should proceed when I do get the laptop. Cheers!"

The card comes with this hard plastic sealed bag and it has a finger printless strip thing on the actual card. On top of the box itself having tape to seal it but obviously that shit isn't hard to put back on. 

I was just wondering, since this is a pretty big amount of money and there is professional scammers how hard would it be to re package this thing and sell it as brand new?

nvidia,ASadTeapot,29,0,"Question regarding my recent Titan Xp purchaseI bought the Star Wars Titan Xp Galactic Empire Edition a few days ago and to no surprise as per usual I bought it as a new line of cards are coming out as I do every year. I've recently found out that the alleged ""GTX 20"" series is coming soon and will be 10 - 15% better than a 1080ti, would I be better off keeping my card (which I love simply because it's a Star Wars Collectors Edition and it's my first Titan ever!) or sending it back and waiting for the new line? (Excluding the Titan V because it's simply out of my price range :p).

Edit: This is my first post here and I only just found out the flairs exist so excuse the excessive use of  ""Question"" in the title :D"

nvidia,TehGM,3,0,"Gsync when only 2nd monitor supports it?Hey, redditors! I hope you find guys and girls can clear my confusion regarding one thing.

So I have a laptop with GTX 1080, and 120Hz nogsync display. Recently I replaced my old TV I used as 2nd monitor with this fine acer predator one that's 165Hz and supports gsync.

When setting up Gsync, it says to switch main monitor to gsync capable one. When I do that, gsync works (I think, I stopped noticing framerate drops even when they happened).

However, I'd like to keep my laptop monitor as main. It's closer to me, and it just makes sense as the keyboard is aligned with it. Now the question is. If I keep my laptop display as main, but run games on 2nd monitor (which is gsync but not set at main), will gsync still kick in?"

I wish to overclock my GTX 1070, it's a blower style fan, but if i adjust fan speeds I can keep it at ~70c under load (Superposition / FireStrike). I'm wondering if it would be possible to overclock the GTX 1070 and not go past my 450W 80+ bronze PSU's limit. I've paired it with an i5-7400 + 8GB DDR4 RAM. Thanks for the input"

Edit: Ok, so maybe what we really want is expensive cards? If cards are cheap, mining is profitable and we lose. If cards are expensive we curb out the miners and get cards after all"
nvidia,oSChakal,11,1,"Need help buying next laptop with nvidia card.Hello folks, I recently bought a MSI GL52M 7rex that came with a 1050ti.

To my surprise, paired with a 7700HQ, this little card can overclock well (1911 mhz max overclock on the core)

I realized that I may not need my full tower now and since I'm still in my 30 days refund window, I was thinking of buying a laptop with either a 1060 or 1070.

I will be playing on 1080p on the laptop and I'll sometime hook my laptop to my 144mhz 1080p monitor.

People say that the 1060 is *overkill* for max/ultra at 1080p but I'm wondering if the extra 250-300 for a 1070 would be justified.

The rest of the laptop is pretty basic; a 7700hq, 16gig of DDR4 @ 2400mhz with a ssd and hard drive except for the screen, I'd go with a 120mhz IPS.

Any help will be appreciated!

*EDIT* If you know any website where you can config your laptop, like eurocom, that ship in Canada, that'd be great!"

240GB SSD

I built this system 5-6 months back (except for the monitor which is 1.5 yrs old). Now i mostly play pvp titles (OW / Destiny 2 / COD BOPS3 etc)

After building the system i realized that its a bit overkill for 1080p gaming. Now i have a few questions regarding this

1-) Is my CPU a bottle neck with the GPU @ 1080p in the above mentioned titles ? ( i Destiny 2 i had to reduce quite a few settings to maintain 120+ fps @ 1080p) 

2-)I can sell my gtx 1080 for a good price and get a 1050ti etc , and use the spare case to buy my son a PS4 or may be a basic gaming PC. Would this be a smart choice ?

3-) How much time will the GPU last me if i play games @ 1080p only ?  I plan to get another monitor , which will probably be 1080p @ 144 fps or may be 60fps depending upon my budget). I plan to set up another monitor for my son to play some old sega / nintendo games via emulation.


4-) At 1080p in almost every game my GPU runs very cool, like sometimes even the fans don`t even turn on in Destiny 2. Reason ?"

I'll admit I don't know too much about mounting bracket sizes, but afaik, nvidia has had the same mounting hole spacing since at least their 600 series

A while ago, I modded my G12 to do [this](https://i.imgur.com/BvyHHNR.mp4), and I would really really like to be able to use the same cooler on a Volta xx60/70 or whatever they'll decide to call their next series, but the mounting spaces seem much larger on the titan V than previous titan cards, which are also compatible with the G12

Basically, I'm worried about them changing the spacing of the mounting holes. Hopefully, NZXT has plans for Volta if they plan on keeping the G12 alive for the next generation of Nvidia cards, if not, I'll have to fashion a custom bracket somehow. 

My question should be pretty obvious now, but should I expect the ""gaming"" cards to have the same mounting holes as the pascal cards?"

That said I'm looking at gtx 1060s and rx 580s. I'm leaning toward a 580 but ain't liking a lot of the options in terms of build quality, reviews, cooling, etc. So a 1060 is still a good possibility for me.

What 1060 would be best for the money? I don't plan to overclock, but I want one that's cool running because come summer I don't have air conditioning in this room so I want one with thermal headroom.

I heard the evga superclocked is good for the price but I hear mixed reports on cooling. I like evga warranties though.

Msi gaming x is a bit more but it looks very solid.

Anyone have any recommendations that don't cost significantly more than $300?

For reference lets aim for me keeping this card for 4 years at 1080p gaming.

EDIT: I'm most likely going 1060 at this point, so the real question is, EVGA SC ($270) or MSI Gaming X ($305)?

nvidia,witcherthesix,18,48,"How To Fix Nvida Control Panel Colors Resetting on Windows 10I'm sure most of you have heard or read on the internet of the issue surrounding the Custom Color setting from the Nvidia Control Panel.

I found an easy solution. I must add, though, that this solution only fixes (and keeps) your custom color settings while on the desktop but they get reset when running full-screen applications like games. For this, you can switch to borderless window and the desktop color configuration will kick in.
Alright, here it is.

1. Press Start and type Color Management.
2. A new window will open up which has your monitors listed on the top. Choose the monitor you will be using for calibration
3. Under the monitor list, UNTICK the ""Use my settings for this device"". Also REMOVE any profiles listed under ""Profiles Associated with this device""
4. Next, Switch to the ""Advanced"" Tab. At the bottom of the Tab, click ""Change System Defaults..""
5. A new window pops up similar to the previous one. Again, REMOVE any color profiles listed as done in previous step and then click the ""Advanced"" Tab.
6. Now, this is the most important step. UNTICK the ""Use Windows Display Calibration"" and click close on both the similar looking windows.
7. Once all that is done step by step, you can go ahead change your color calibration under Nvidia Control Panel like you normally would and hit Apply. Once your custom setting is applied, this will stick no matter what and only be controlled by the Nvidia Control Panel as opposed to Windows
Try resetting your PC and see that this setting will work every time you log on. Profit

I realize support isn't as good as it once was, but if you don't have the patience and wanna pull the trigger now 20-50% performance uplift is going to put you on par with the next generation of GPUs anyway.

nvidia,RRiasu,15,1,What budget power supply would you recommend for a Zotac GeForce GTX 1060 3gb.
nvidia,ThisPlaceisHell,24,0,"165hz forces GPU to run higher than necessary clocks in gameFor anyone with a 165hz monitor, and especially those who play older games where you don't need your modern GPU to be running at max turbo clocks, maybe try backing off to 144hz instead.

On my flair system with a PG279Q at 165hz, playing old games like Max Payne, Half Life, Hitman etc all force my GPU to 3D boost clocks and memory profiles. The funny thing is, GPU usage is rarely above 5% at these target clocks.

If I switch to 144hz instead, my GPU practically sits idle in most of these games, downclocking to 139Mhz on the lowest and up to 684Mhz on the highest. This means my GPU can effectively sit in idle to 2D clocks, drastically lowering power consumption and heat generated, and still produce my target framerate in these games.

I think this might just be a bug in the drivers that forces the GPU to sit in turbo clocks when it detects that &gt;144hz is being used. It's wasteful and unnecessary so I've decided to just stick to 144hz from now on.

If anyone else with this refresh rate and modern GPUs can confirm this scenario, I'd really appreciate it. I've seen this phenomenon follow me through multiple Windows formats (after the FCU fiasco) so I know it's not my software configuration. Thanks."

I currently have a gtx960 and its getting harder and harder to run my favorite games.

There's a bunch of mixed ""predictions"", some even say Volta wont be for consumer. I can spare 400-500 for a GPU right now, should I just go for a 1080/1070ti now, or wait for a few more month?

nvidia,Rattlessnakes,15,8,"Evga gtx 970 FTW - Did I just get extremely unlucky with this chip?So we are at a time where amazing hardware can be obtained at reasonable prices(except for the pathetic ram prices). But I just don’t have the money to go grab a new pascal chip. When I got my 970ftw, It was the biggest purchase I made on something that was for my enjoyment and brand new. It is still capable, but extremely inconsistent.

So I have lurked here and in other related subs for years and am some what knowledgeable on hardware. I decided to give overclocking a go. I downloaded afterburner and Heaven to get started. I bumped up core +30 and Memory +30. Got through heaven fine on the high default preset. I did notice some weird texture weirdness but I assumed it was just the old benchmarking software. So I went back and bumped core +60 and Memory +80, both monitors turned gray and heaven crashed. 


Now I was under the assumption that the way all these variants of a certain gpu model work is the higher the out of box clock speed relates to the physical quality of the silicon in the chip. The FTW model is a higher end variant of my specific gpu model and I thought I would be able to get a somewhat decent oc no problem since I never see temps reach above the low 70’s.  Could this be an issue with my setup or software, or is this just how the silicon lottery works?

nvidia,hyperwarpstream,8,3,"What would it take for a G-Sync Notebook to be more power efficient or work with Optimus?As you know with a G-Sync notebook one of the downsides is that it disallows the use of Optimus / Graphics Switching. Since the iGPU is that much more power efficient, the battery life drops dramatically (for example look at some of the reviews of Alienware before/after G-Sync).


Now I guess the tradeoff was done as the target market for such notebooks doesn't necessarily need such long battery life. However as a type of person who kind of wants jack-of-all-trades notebook that can do it all, I kind of wish there was a way for this to happen. I am aware some notebooks do workaround this, with some of the Sager/Clevo notebook being an example as they use a MUX in some of their notebook for the display connection to be able to switch between Optimus and G-Sync; however not many other manufacturers go that route as it does add an additional cost, and it also requires a reboot as well.


My hope is that there becomes a way where both could work at the same time or that somehow dGPUs somehow gain some new tech to be super power efficient for like 2D / desktop applications. Does anyone see nVidia somehow pulling this off somehow in the future? Or will this be a forever pipe dream?"

# Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue** 

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that's if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are.

So in order for them to know what's going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](http://surveys.nvidia.com/index.jsp?pi=6e7ea6bb4a02641fa8f07694a40f8ac6) to Nvidia.

A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* If you are having issue installing the driver for GTX 1080/1070/1060 on Windows 10, make sure you are on the latest build for Fall Creators Update (Version 1709. Build 16299). If you are on the older build (e.g. 10240), you need to update your windows. Press Windows Key + R and type winver to check your build version.

* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install. 

* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.

* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem. 

* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

#Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and  you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*

* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*

* **What does the new Power Management option ""Optimal Power"" means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people.

##For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes.

##Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad."
nvidia,sprinks83,12,0,"Enabling vsync in NCP if you use a fps limiter?After perusing reddit following the purchase of my z35p gsync monitor, the general consensus seems to be that I should enable gsync &amp; vsync in the ncp and turn vsync off in game.  I'm just a little confused as to why I should enable vsync at all if I'm capping my frame rate at 117 fps with nvidia inspector (i've read that rtss is better for frame capping but I cant seem to launch it for some reason).

I'm also a little disappointed that some games have microstutter with gsync enabled.  Most games work great but a few have this issue.  I was hoping that disabling vsync in the ncp when I get home tonight will fix this problem. 

At first i was worried that I had a defective module, but if that were the case why would the majority of my games run as smooth as you'd hope when gsync is enabled?

2 of the last 4 games I purchased have this problem.  Shadow of War &amp; AC: Origins run silky smooth but Evil Within 2 &amp; to a much lesser extent, Battlefront 2 have occasional stutters.  Especially during cutscenes.

Any help would be greatly appreciated :)"

I had money aside as well for a GTX 1080TI, but had to cut back my budget due to unexpected circumstances. I've had the monitor for a few months (Acer XB270HU G-Sync), so I can't return it. 

However, I'm still looking forward to 1440p gaming and was wondering which graphics card would be the minimum for high settings at near or 60+ fps. I plan on playing (PUBG, Shadow of War, Skyrim SE, SW: Battlefront 2, Total War: Warhammer 2). Would a 1070 be enough to make the cut? I really can't afford to spend more than $430.00 for a while. "

nvidia,FarSolar,8,106,"About Nvidia Capture Server streaming audio from someone else's game.I previously made a post about Nvidia Capture Server streaming audio from someone else's game while I was playing it. I ran into this same issue while playing Divinity again and found that it was actually Steam that was causing this strange issue. I had thought it was Nvidia Capture Server that was sending me the audio but that was just from it recording the audio I was receiving for Shadowplay. There was an audio source for Steam Broadcasting that I completely missed because it was at the end of the list of audio mixer sources and there was already the regular Steam source that I expected it to come from. It seems that it would play audio from someone's Steam Broadcast for no discernible reason. The audio I've gotten from people indicates that they don't know someone is listening to their stream so they're either hosting a private stream for a friend or Steam is telling them that they have 0 viewers. I also found some previous posts on the steam forums and reddit about this broadcast issue so it may be reproducible somehow. Sorry about misleading everyone with the whole, ""nvidia is recording me,"" stuff.

tl;dr This isn't actually some kind of nvidia conspiracy and Steam needs to fix this because it's creepy."

I've never owned anything sync monitor before so that would be new to me, I've also never owned an IPS panel before, only TN displays for as long as I can recall. 24"" is also the biggest display I've used, never even seen how 1440p is in practice besides from streams.

I was thinking of using my current XL2411Z as a second monitor for streams or give it to my brother, while I'd upgrade to the XB271HU bmpirz(https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/predator-model/UM.HX1AA.001) myself.

Why that monitor? It's really the only once that I find looks good(I have a complete red/black theme, gpu, mobo, case, keyboard...), and it's really the only one besides the ASUS counterpart I can get here unless I wanna pay 100€+ for shipping from the US, I rather have warranty from my country and less trouble to be honest here.

nvidia,Pillepinball,27,7,"Help me properly undervolt a gtx 1080Hello dear redditors

I have been trying to squeeze some more power out of my strix 1080 (a8g 11gbps), but have had limited success in doing so. During gaming sessions it hovers around 1900mhz, which is too low for my taste.

I initially tried standard overclocking using the sliders in MSI AB, but I could not even hit 2ghz stable. It seemed to be due to power throttling as it often was above 115% (120% limit).

I then figured I would go for undervolting with a smaller OC. I attempted a number of voltages around or below 1.0v and frequencies just below 2ghz. I got decent results with 1.0v and 1987mhz with heaven. I used the voltage/frequency curve, so the voltage will increase up to 1.0v when it should hit 1987mhz and then I set the points to the right of this at the same frequency level. However, 3dMark will crash quite fast as it sets higher clocks and a lot more voltage. Similarly, Heaven and PUBG also starts with a higher voltage (however same clock), but will then after some time settle on the voltage I have specified.

So can someone help me understand why especially 3dMark but also other software can draw more voltage and set higher clocks than specified through AB?
Is GPU boost overriding some stuff? 

Would also love to have experiences from other gtx 1080 owners :)

I picked up a Benq XL2730z 1440p 144hz freesync monitor a couple months back for an absolute steal and I'm planning to build my rig in early December. I have all of my parts except the graphics card.

I thought the custom vega cards would be out by now, but I guess not...

Should I try to stick around with my initial idea of getting a custom Asus V56 or Sapphire V56 (if they're even going to get released) or just buy a GTX 1080? I'm in Canada and right now the V56 is $655 and the GTX 1080 I'm looking at is appx $720, my budget after tax is ~$800 btw.

Is it worth waiting for vega so I get freesync capabilities or should I get a 1080? I'm okay with dropping settings from ultra to high but I don't want to regret my decision if I get a 1080 and then notice tearing/stuttering because it'll really take me out of my game.

P.S. I'm going to be playing all types of games: fps, open world 3rd person, sports, racing, etc.

It is exampled as if the hardware is indeed in Geforce cards but is being walled off in software. Can this be confirmed whether or not the hardware is actually there and was actually enabled and accessible but then was suddenly disabled by Nvidia? If so, is this hardware actually being used in Nvidia Gamestream but is being nerfed w.r.t to access outside of it? 


 

I am working on a completely unrelated project but have been pulling my hair out about this. My main question is if (NvFBC/NvIFR) hardware is actually on Geforce cards. Second, was it at one point accessible via sdks, drivers, and software. If the answer to this is yes, I have an interesting side-project lined up and would like a confirmation if the hardware is there so I know how to proceed."

nvidia,LoLstatpadder,4,1,"Is this PSU enough for a Gigabyte Windforce 980ti?I got a nice price for a 980ti (considering the current price of 1070 that is) and i'm wondering if my psu is enough.

nvidia,justbronzestuff,13,0,"New to nvidia, GPU Boost 3.0 vs MSI Afterburner?So, I just went from a RX480 to a GTX1080Ti. The last nvidia card I had was a 9600GT (a long long time ago), and between then and now I kind of dumped PC, so I'm now very ignorant in a lot of matters concerning it.

I know that there is GPU Boost 3.0, which automatically overclocks your GPU, proportionally to your thermal margin. 

However, my GTX1080Ti is very hot (Not the model I wanted, it's a white Gigabyte model Gaming OC 11GB. It doesn't have the best performance nor cooling, but it was on sale for a very cheap price. Even thought it was a scam, but it works perfectly.) and I'm currently using MSI Afterburner to set a new fan curve and raise my power limit. 

My question is: Does using afterburner (since it sets a clock for boost clock and normal clock) prevents GPU Boost 3.0 to work as intended. And even if does or doesn't, how much better is it to overclock manually, instead of using GPU Boost 3.0?

Thank you very much."

Im on a i5 3570k at 4.1ghz, 16 gb ram and a gtx 660 atm.

Monitor 1080p 60hz at the moment but plan on buying 1080p 144hz monitor. Playing Pubg as most demanding and whatever new games come on this year.

2º Zotac AMP! 1060 6gb - new - 279€

3º Gigabyte 1080 windforce (not g1) - new - 515€



Budget is enough for the 1080, just trying to be efficient with the money.

Will the 1060 be able to get me 144fps for my new monitor with my current cpu? Maybe 970 + upgrade to volta in 1 year? Will my cpu bottleneck the 1080 too much? (not planning on upgrading cpu soon)

nvidia,frostcanadian,10,1,"Asus Rog Strix GTX 1080 Ti OCSo I'm a new in the universe of overclocking. I bought the OC edition of the GTX 1080 Ti, because it has higher clock speed. When I bought it, the difference between the 2 editions was like $10 (also the non-oc edition was out of stock at the time, so I didn't really have a choice^ ^ ).

So now I'm just wondering what exactly does the OC mean. I did some research on the web (basically searched on Google^ ^ ) to find what did I buy for $10. Now I found 2 1/2 answers.

1. It's an OCed version of the card. So in other word, Asus already OCed your card so you don't have to do it yourself.

2. Asus tested the card to make sure that if you decide to OC it, it will stay stable until a certain boost clock (1708 MHz in this case). Then, you just have to OC the card by choosing the ""OC mode"". Which uses Asus fans curve, which I hate because my card goes up to 81-82C° (it stays between 74-78C­°) while my custom fans curve maitains the temp to 68-74C° and sometimes it will reach 75-76C°.
1/2. Asus only tested the card and you have to create your own OCed profile.

So I just want to know which of theses answers is the good one (if there is a good one^ ^ ).

Edit: My ^ ^ didn't work at first"

Finally after plugging into the bottom card, my display came back and its been like that ever since, plugging it into the top one shows no image.

nvidia,RSF_Deus,9,6,"Just found a trick regarding Painkiller : Black Edition !(I rewrited the post because it was going too far into experimentations)

So if you guys know this game, you probably already faced the 60 Hz fullscreen lock problem. I just recently discovered 2 very interesting things ! Didn't test it on AMD though, but since it is an Nvidia reddit, well... :) It is on Windows 10 Creator :

First, the 60 Hz fullscreen lock problem is due to one thing : MSAA, the antialiasing option available in the game's menu. If your monitor is running desktop overclocked higher refreshrate (like 75Hz or more) it will lock to native (60Hz in my case), but there is a way to bypass this, and even do a lot more !!!

Put your game in compatibility mode for Windows 8, and the game will run borderless windowed with some kind of fast v-sync in effect !! even if your nvidia options are set to default ! this is not even a joke ! 700 FPS no tearing high framerate (on my GTX 1060, so the mouse feels as responsive as possible)

I can't believe it works lol ! super responsive no tearing high framerate and refreshrate borderless Painkiller black edition maxed out with 4xMSAA ! (don't put it a 6 it doesn't work)

- EDIT : DAMN I knew it was too good to be true, the framepacing isn't correct, nothing gamebraking really and a far cry from the heavy tearing or lags traditionnal Vsync does on this game but still.
Since RivaTuner doesn't seem to be able to hook on the process, I will see if I can't get RivaTuner to work at 150 FPS lock instead of nvidia framerate limiter, I usually get better results like this.

- EDIT 2 : And indeed I have, the results are good and the mouse feels responsive, but very rarely, the game stutters at occasion, I know it is a very common problem with DX9 games running windowed. So I guess theres two options, either you run the game with the windows 8 compatibility mode trick at stupidly high framerates with or without a lock (depending on how much you are sensitive to framepacing), or you run the game normal but with ingame MSAA disabled (but you can totally enable it outside in drivers), in this mode I wouldn't recomment v-sync since it introduces the melee hit lag problem. You can enable Pascal's Fast V-Sync and it works, but it kind of introduces the same problems than the retrocompatibility mode, occasional stutters."

nvidia,MAGNIRON,20,1,"Jumped on the 1080ti train but I'm wondering if my Hybrid is normal sounding...So how loud should the EVGA 1080ti SC2 Hybrid actually be? Is there any videos/recordings so I can confirm I'm supposed to hear this sound and how loud? I've never had an AIO before so I'm curious if this is normal or excessive. I tried to capture it myself but it all I can hear are fans, even if I make them spin at their lowest. Though I barely hear the fans in person and even if I turn them up, they're a soothing sound. Not like this buzz noise.

I've heard about pump noise, especially on these ones always running 100%. But I wasn't expecting this static/buzzing noise to be this loud with a closed case. It overpowers my case fans and even with my Define C can't quiet it down, but it does help more than having the side panel off. My PC sounds like a refrigerator now, is this meant to be how it should sound?

It's hard to explain without recording it, but there is no way for me to capture this noise. I've heard about air bubbles being trapped but I positioned it so they were at the bottom of the radiator like it showed in the instructions and what I read online. I tried moving the tubes too, just to see if I could quiet it down, but nothing changes.

My Corsair H110i makes no sound though and it's set to performance too which is why I'm a little confused if it's meant to be or not. 

But the good thing I can say so far, it's extremely cool! GPU 1 on idle is 27C, Mem 1/2 are 31C, PWR 1/4 are 33C and the rest are all 32C. This is using the ICX sensors, and it's just mind-blowing as I came from a 40C+ idle GPU. I haven't fully tested it yet but I'm going to OC it first and find stability, then see how well our temps fare.

But before I even begin overclocking, I want to know I don't have a faulty card and if t'd be smarter to RMA it now before something bad happens. Thanks for the assistance!

EDIT: Forgot to mention, I've replaced the GPU radiator fan with a Corsair ML120 that's plugged into my motherboard. I tried to set it to 50% constant in the BIOS, though if it ever hits 70C or higher the BIOS says it'll go to 100%, but I'm not expecting that hot so hopefully it's not going to spin that fast.

EDIT2: Managed to record the sound, I had to take off the case panel and record up close to the GPU to actually show the sound it makes, though the recording sounds a lot more emphasized and louder than I hear with my case closed. Also the buzzing is a lot lower on the recording. To my ears it's a lot higher sounding but not as powerful. If that makes sense.

* This is the closest to what I hear as a buzz sound: https://vocaroo.com/i/s03cXAZvUyQk
* This is just me recording a different position if it helps though it's a lot lower sounding: https://vocaroo.com/i/s1NBjIWcmd7e

nvidia,apoptygma,29,2,"I'm having some real issues getting g-sync to workI've also posted this on the official forums but I figured it can't hurt to reach out to this community too.


I'm using a laptop with an AU Optronics 120hz g-sync screen (AUO LCD B156HTN05.2.) and currently Dual-booting Arch Linux (kernel 4.12.6-1) &amp; Windows 10. 

In Win10 I can't find an option in the most recent GeForce Drivers/Experience to 'enable visual indicator' however I'm fairly certain that the g-sync isn't working despite being enabled in the nVidia Control panel. It appears to 'work' on the pendulum demo when set to 50fps however there's no indicator on screen or in the ALT-Z overlay.

In Arch I'm seeing screen tearing on Dota 2 &amp; Diablo 3 when pushing around 100fps in either game, this is reduced the closer I get to 120 fps so I can only assume that means I'm not getting g-sync enabled. It's enabled in the nvidia-settings application (along with the visual indicator which isn't displaying)

I'm unclear where the 'visual indicator' is supposed to be rendered, If it's a flag sent to the display that triggers an OSD dialog I'm probably out of luck as (with most laptops) there's no OSD on this panel. If it's meant to be rendered by the driver as an overlay then it's defiantly not working.

Is there any possible way to force an overlay or response from the display, in either OS that will confirm that the panel is syncing with the video output?

On a side-note this device has a UEFI bios setting to allow toggling between DISCREET &amp; MYHYBRID which I've currently set to DISCREET which disabled the integrated GPU in order to give the GeForce 1070 sole control over the panel which I understand is a requirement for g-sync to function. I can confirm this has taken effect as neither OS detected the intel integrated graphics from the kaby lake CPU."

As of now I'm still using my old 1920x1080 screen and would like to switch to something bigger.

Ideally I want a 32 inch VA panel with decent response, not particularly interested in 144Hz and adaptive refresh.

Sadly, no 4k monitors that fit these criteria exist currently, the closest is the Benq PD3200U, which is an IPS panel. A really nice one, but still IPS. On top of that it's really quite expensive.

I bought a Samsung S32D850T 32'' 1440p monitor two weeks ago, but ended up returning it because of some banding issues and it losing DP connnectivity. Loved the big screen though, it's definitely the size I want for my new monitor.

So now I'm looking at the Benq PD3200Q, which is again 32'' VA 1440p, ~7 ms input lag and decent response times.

Not sure if I should pull the trigger - I'm worried I'll regret spending the money a year from now because there will finally be 4k monitors that fullfil my criteria.

Any recommendations? Should I buy now or should I wait? I can always sell it later I suppose."

I still have to test it in my PC but he showed it installed in his PC and it was working great (was playing Modern Warfare). 

He also claimed that he changed the thermal paste a couple of days ago with a quality one (cooler master). The card came without the original box (but he provided a couple of PSU cables). Aesthetically it's in very good shape, at first glance at least.

Considering the current market and prices, and assuming the card will work great, did I get a good deal? I was looking for nice GPU on a tight budget, but maybe there were better choices for that price?"

nvidia,l187l,7,3,"A few question about GTX 1070 overclock/voltageI've had my 1070 Gaming X since launch and just assumed setting the max voltage and power limit would allow me to get the best overclock even with the 1.093v limit. So I've just left it like that since then.

When I saw the thing about undervolting the Vega FE and it running better, I decided to see what my 1070 would do.

I have that driver thing that is supposed to boost performance for the Gaming X cards, not sure if this increases the base voltage.

I turned the voltage all the way down to 0% in MSI AB and was able to get identical clocks as before and it's still using 1.081v(which is normal for firestrike test, it rarely goes all the way to 1.093v). 

Do these cards go all the way up to 1.093v even without changing the voltage boost if they have thermal headroom? My temps stay around 40c. Is it the MSI Gaming X performance boost thing?(I forgot what it's called, but it raises the default boost clock)"

nvidia,zer0_reaper,14,0,"1080Ti SC2 Hybrid pump noise? Is there any video about it? Would anyone be kind enough to record its sound at idle/load?So far from what I can see people's opinion on watercooled 1080Tis are very mixed. Some say that the pump on sea hawk x/sc2 hybrid are totally quiet and some say that they're loud at idle.

Therefore, would anyone be kind enough to record a video of their 1080Ti Seahawk X or their 1080Ti SC2 hybrid (if they have one) WHEN their PC is on idle (with all of other case fans set to 500 - 600 RPM as well as when their PC is on full load) to show how ""silent"" the pump really is?

I'm not too worried about the radiator's fan noise because I know I can just replace the fan with a noctua or something so that's okay. What I'm really worried about is the pump noise.

Cheers guys, just want to thank you so much in advance, I know it's a quiet hefty request but I really need to know what the noise is like before dropping my money on one of these GPUs.

Really appreciate it!"

My priority is to have the card as silent as possible. 
I don't have a water cooled PC tho, and I never tried water cooling, so I'm not sure if you can just install the SC Black Hybrid straight away in an idiot proof way.

The Asus is renowned for the best, most quiet air cooling around (for the 1080Ti, that is). But I've heard that Hybrid cooling will always be more quiet anyway.

nvidia,chad97d,12,0,"Hypothetically, what would the performance be for a 4-way SLI with four Titan Xp's?This is something I'm pondering.

Now, maybe the Titan Xp might not be the best in terms of cost and market value, but based on my research, it is superior to the GTX 1080 Ti, and is currently the most powerful GPU dedicated solely for gaming. As it's 10% better in terms of benchmarks, hopefully that means that I would obtain better performance with a Titan Xp than a GTX 1080 Ti. If I'm wrong, please let me know.

Now, then I got to thinking. I believe that the Titan Xp can support up to 4-way SLI. I know that SLI consumes a lot more power, costs a lot more, and so on and so forth, but... what about the actual performance it could offer graphically?

I know that SLI is intended to boost the frame rate, but outside of that, I don't know much about SLI other than diminishing returns. However, even if it's the most minute performance, it's still an increase in performance.

So... what would be the results?"

nvidia,chad97d,27,0,"Is the Titan Xp meant for gaming?I'm currently comparing the specs for the Titan Xp (the newest one with the lowercase ""p"") with the GeForce 1080 Ti. Now, some have said that the 1080 Ti is built solely for gaming in mind, and that the Titan X line isn't. However, after comparing the specs side-by-side, it seems like the Titan Xp would be the better of the two in terms of actual gaming performance.

From what I've seen, the Titan Xp has the exact same specs as the 1080 Ti in just about everything, and for the specs that aren't equivalent, the Titan Xp has superior ones. The Titan Xp has...

- 256 more CUDA cores
- a memory speed boost of 0.4 gigabits per second
- one more gigabyte of memory
- 32 extra bits of interface width (not sure what this is, tbh)
- a bandwidth boost of 63.7 gigabytes per second

So far, it seems like the Titan Xp wins out in terms of specs. Heck, it even has the same TPD, display connectors, resolution support, technology support, and is even the same size. The 1080 Ti is meant to be fast, but the Titan Xp has the same clock speed.

Of course, while the Titan Xp is technically superior in terms of these specs, it is almost double the cost. Now, assuming that someone has the fices to be able to afford a powerful PC with no budget limit, should they pick the 1080 Ti or the Titan Xp if they want to have THE best performance they can get, and why that one?"

Anyone ever been in this scenario?  (*I hope not, but asking).  It's certainly nothing pressing as I don't need to put it back on anytime soon, however was thinking if I ever try to resell, it might sell easier with the reference cooler.

Think Nvidia, or PNY (Reference brand) would sell me a pack?  I'd prefer that way, however if the only option is 3rd party, or hardware store then so be it.

Card is only DDR3 but for the most part I'm pleased with it's performance. I'm limited in my upgrade options of course. Can't buy a new motherboard, CPU or any of that or else I'd build a foundation that didn't require low-profile. 

Now the motherboard in this computer says the PCI-E slot is only 50W. This GTX745 is 55 watts. Haven't had any issues with it but obviously I'd like a bit more performance. GT1030 offer any performance gains over this card or not? I wish I could run a GTX1050 but not sure if PCI-E slot could handle it. I've heard people having success with the GTX750 but not sure if that's a big gain over the 745.

My card base boost clock speed is 1670. I know it's going higher that that but the thing is:
In-game when my gpu usage is about 90-99%, clock speed varies from 1600 mhz to 1680 mhz.

But in menu, or when enabling v-sync( gpu usage about. 50-80 %) clock speed varies from 1750-1880 mhz. 

After overclocking in msi afterburner +100 mhz clock and +200 memory, its the same thing , but 1650-1750 mhz when gpu usage above 90 %, and 1850- 1980 mhz when usage below 70-80%. 

In Benchmarks the same. Fire strike score after this oc 9800. Valley benchmark on default setting (aa off etc) about 3250.

Temps are fine. With cooling feature enabled, not going above 65 C. 

Shouldn't it be opposite? I mean stable about. 1900 mhz. after oc with gpu usage above 90 %, and lower with v-sync, when gpu usage is below 80%?"

[PCB, VRM, noise]I understand that the performance will be pretty much the same (right?) and the differences that do might pop up might as well be attributed to the silicon lottery. However, there are other aspects that should be looked at, such as VRM, PCB and fan noise.

A redditor [claimed](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/6712t0/1080ti_strix_vs_ftw3/dgmvzce/) that his Strix is very noisy. Not sure, some people claim that EVGA is more noisy... Other people [claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/66oahv/asus_strix_vs_evga_ftw3_for_1080_ti_quality/) that EVGA has the better VRM, while Asus has the better PCB (probably due to the fact that Asus now assembles their line automatically). What would you say is more important?

So I have been able to narrow my 2 cards to these: the MSI 1070 gaming x and the EVGA 1070 ftw. Usually I am all about EVGA. From the customer service to the awesome factory oc cards right out of the box they have always been my brand. Now I am familiar with this whole EVGA cards blowing up thing which is why I'm debating between these 2. From what I understand the issue has been resolved and it's a very very very small chance you will get one of the defective ones however I am still cautious. So the second best card in my research has been the MSI gaming x mostly because of its twin frozr tech. I enjoy EVGA for their overclocks right out of the box as I'm not one much for overclocking but might try someday. However as I have read the MSI comes with this gaming app that can put the card in oc mode and give me the exact same clocks as the EVGA one. But I still love me my EVGA and trust them very much but figured I'd ask you the good people of Reddit. So what do you recommend for me?  Thanks"

Currently, I have Zotac GTX 760 Amp! Edition. But i want to upgrade my GPU. Then I'll need a proper 144hz monitor for gaming. GPU choice will be primarily for video editing, then of course for gaming.

So I stuck between new Radeon RX580 and GTX 1060-1070-1080. I know gaming performance will be amazing especially with 1080. But if there won't be a noticeable difference between 1080 and 1060-RX580 on video editing, i can settle for 1060 or RX580. 

In Adobe forums, I see people complaining about CUDA issues while using Adobe Apps with 1000 series nVidia Gpu's. They say they can't even use CUDA feature while previewing or exporting video. When they try to use CUDA feature, blank screen appears on Preview screen and they can't export just using GPU. (Especially Premiere Pro and After Effects)

Is this a driver related problem? Do you think it'll be fixed with newer drivers soon? Who is responsible for this problem? :)

I just upgraded from my 2x 290's to a single GTX 1080 FE.  Playing Witcher 3 on ultra no hairworks I'm getting about 100-110 fps on my trusty 2500k @ 4.3ghz. 

1. My cards temp hovers at 82c, is that normal? My card was bought used.

2. If I'm getting over 100 fps should I still be using vsync? My monitor is 1080p 60hz.  

3. Am I missing out by not using a monitor with a higher refresh rate? What's the difference in gameplay going from 60hz to 144hz with my current setup?

4. If I had to upgrade, which would be best direction if I could only do one, new platform (cpu, board, mem) or new monitor?

nvidia,roshkiller,4,5,"Moving from R9 Nano to GTX 1070Been a loyal AMD user since the 9700 (9700, 4850, 4870, 6850, 7800, 7950, R9 Nano) series. This is my first GeForce card and my mind is absolutely blown away by two things of the card:

1) Lack of heat

2) Noise level

**Background:** I had an ITX case (Sugo SG-13) and went for the R9 Nano naturally because of limiting size factors (also meant more room for larger AIO's or SSDs). It also packed more performance, while having decent memory capacity as well. Its performance at 1000Mhz was better than the GTX 980 at that time, and also 4GB HBM &gt; 4GB GDDR5.

The R9 Nano was awesome in performance, but one thing that bothered me was its default fan profile by AMD, which made the card enter the 85C envelope easily causing it to thermal throttle massively. The fan curve itself was not aggressive enough to dissipate heat faster than the rate at which the chip got hotter. This meant that my chip was 85C with the fans heating up my case over time. I had to manually adjust the sensitivity of the fan curve via BIOS to ramp up faster. At 50-60% it also meant the fan was pretty noisy and to maintain 1000Mhz at 60 fps (V-synced) at games like ROTR, meant the fan speed had to be at 100% which was very annoying. Even with headphones, the sound was noticeable and made worse by the fact that the case was compact and perforated for ventilation so no sound was damped. I thought of water-cooling the thing. But my primary workloads are two things - gaming and rendering.

Rendering. The primary reason for ditching AMD was the lack of rendering API support. Their blender OpenCL support is lacklustre (they announced since Oct or Dec last year that an AMD plugin would be released Q1 2017 and 10 days left and no sign of a release). Many other packages have iRay or some form of CUDA acceleration, whereas AMD has open-sourced solutions which devs work on ""for free"" and therefore bugs and optimizations are often ignored (eg LuxRender engine - if you post an issue there, their reply is ""AMD not really helping us solve issues"").

I also envied that some games had settings like High, Ultra, Nvidia .... (Nvidia being the highest and only for NVidia users) on games like FarCry 4. Nvidia always manages to get themselves in between the console to PC porting process and throw in their propriety effects which 1) affects competition performance and 2) benefits NVidia users only.

The GFE thing didn't bother me. Made an NVidia account and that was it, they can share whatever info they want from there lol.

**TLDR**: Ditched AMD for lack of support in rendering, found GTX 1070 to be superior in terms of cooling (mostly because it was AIB cooling?) heat production and API support. 

People shouldn't have to go through hoops and shit just to get a product working optimally ... (looks over at Ryzen). Ofcourse I still don't support shady practices by either companies - Intel, AMD or NVidia. And still want AMD to succeed so that prices can be better overall for users."

nvidia,Trilink,145,27,"Is gsync still worth it if buying a 1080 Ti?Hi, 

I'm planning on upgrading my pc pretty soon. Right now I'm gaming on an old Samsung monitor with a 770 gtx. 

I'm strongly considering going ultrawide (1440p) and gsync.  AOC is releasing a monitor soon that has all this at a reasonable price. The only downside is the restriction to 100hz but as I'm coming from an older monitor I think the increase to 100hz in itself is going to be awesome, as long as I'm not able to compare to 144hz. 

I'm also holding out for the 1080 Ti. The only question I have: is it worth going the extra mile and getting the 1080 Ti or should I go with the cheaper 1080 and let gsync do its magic? 

I'm thinking that the 1080 Ti can handle 1440p 100hz most of the time and gsync will not be used used when i'm hitting 100. I might be wrong though.

Thanks for helping me out.

- one heat pipe is missing
- Twin Frozr V fans (gaming x has Twin Frozr VI)
- 100Mhz Lower boost speed
- no leds ( which I don't care at all)

# Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue** 

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that's if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are.

So in order for them to know what's going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](http://surveys.nvidia.com/index.jsp?pi=6e7ea6bb4a02641fa8f07694a40f8ac6) to Nvidia.

A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

---

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* If you are having issue installing the driver for GTX 1080/1070/1060 on Windows 10, make sure you are on the latest build 1607 (14393) a.k.a ""Anniversary Update"". If you are on the older build (e.g. 10240), you need to update your windows. Press Windows Key + R and type winver to check your build version.

* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install. 

* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.

* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem. 

* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

---

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

#Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and  you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*

* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*

* **What does the new Power Management option ""Optimal Power"" means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people.

1) Windows Installer installed the product. Product Name: NVIDIA PhysX. Product Version: 9.10.0513. Product Language: 1033. Manufacturer: NVIDIA Corporation. Installation success or error status: 0.
2) Windows Installer installed the product. Product Name: NVIDIA PhysX. Product Version: 9.14.0702. Product Language: 0. Manufacturer: NVIDIA Corporation. Installation success or error status: 0.
Also in Nvidia control panel in SystemInformation-&gt;Components Physx is shown as 9.10.0513 version. It seems that is a pretty old one version.

MY OS is Windows 10 Home 64 bit.

nvidia,vanjamer,3,0,"GTX 670 vs GTX 1050 ti.The last year i just got my hands on a second hand GTX 670, a bit old but still has a good performance, but now with the new GTX 1000 series i put my eye in the GTX 1050 ti. I'm a bit curious about this card, from what i read this have a perfomance similar to a GTX 680, but builded with the last technology, offering ""better performance on the most modern games"" with a lower power consumption and the twice vram.

The point of this, the price of the card is about a 15% more costly than the price i paid for the 670, and i still can sell the card for the price i paid before, my doubt is, worth buying a gtx 1050 ti ?, i know, this don't seems like an ""upgrade"", maybe the framerates will be just a little higher, but i can have a more modern card for almost the same price.

My other doubt about this are the old games, the only comparison i have between this cards is crysis 3, where the 670 have 55 fps vs 35 from the 1050 ti, why is this happening if in the same test with battlefield 4 the 670 have 52 and the 1050 ti 66?.

Thanks in advance for your replies.

I recently purchased the Razer Blade with GTX 1060. I was wondering how I can have the 1060 work on some games. I was playing Overwatch earlier but the graphics were set to medium and screen resolution was below 1920 X 1080 and there was also horizontal screen tearing which seems odd considering this is a 1060 and it runs Skyrim on ultra high with no issues.

nvidia,Spacewalrus2010,21,1,"Debating gsync monitor vs new gpuSo built a pc last summer. Current specs are: gtx 1070, i5 6600k, and a really cheap [1440p 60hz monitor] (https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA4JH1GM6846).

Overall I don't face too many problems with the build. I sit comfortably between 50-60 fps in most games on ultra. From what I've read gsync just makes everything smooth, but so does higher fps of course. 

So I guess I need to hear from those who don't have ""sensitive eyes"" because I never really had a problem with screen tearing, and while I've encountered stuttering I assumed it was because I was walking into an intensive scene (like a ridiculous amount of foliage in a modded FO4).

My conflict is I would like to get a 1080 ti, but if gsync/144hz is a case of ""you don't notice the difference till ya see it"" I might as well try that instead, I guess? "

nvidia,bgutheil,48,2,"Has anyone moved from an RX 480 to a 1070?I want to upgrade from my RX 480. I'm very close to clicking purchase on [this](http://imgur.com/a/Cf1Do). As with any purchase upward of $50 though my heart is in my throat.

My reasons for NOT doing it:

* The RX 480 is operational and fine for most games

* Vega details are around the corner and I may be shooting myself in the foot.

* Will I just want to upgrade again in another year? Or will the 1070 have a bit more longevity than that?

Reasons for doing it:

* Awesome deal. And I can afford it

* Nvidia seems to be doing better with emulators like Cemu at the moment and I'm hoping to play Breath of the Wild once it's ready.

* Skyrim modding always needs extra performance overhead.

* Vega architecture or Polaris 12, whichever AMD chooses to fill the gap between the RX 480/580 and the RX Vega, will most likely compete with the 1070 performance wise rather than blow it out of the water. I'm really just looking for a little more oomph than the 480, and if a 1070 offers that *now* as opposed to AMD offering the same oomph a little later, then why not now? This might not be the best reason though. Just blind speculation.

Let me know what y'all think. Any help at all is appreciated. "

To those who have had a GPU long term and didnt fiddle with fan curves, did running the GPU at its temp soft-limit have any affect on life or performance longevity? I would expect a No, because i imagine nvidia designs and sets a max temperature to be within safe limits for extended use. Is there REALLY harm in running a gpu at its default max temp all the time?  Or is that just something that we all assume is bad? "

Is overclocking the clock speed on an FE just more or less a lost cause because the OC is lost within a few minutes?

nvidia,Killerbear_02,13,3,"MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X Coil Whine FixMy System:

* Mainboard: Gigabyte H170-D3HP-CF
* CPU: Intel i5-6600
* PSU: Cooler Master Real Power M700 (very old PSU from 2007)

In idle desktop work, the card is making 0 noise.
No coil whine, no fan sound, no nothing. Very impressive.

But under load, the card started to scream very load.
i can here it with closed case and headphones on.

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1D74rWdM4I

So i took the card to a friend and tried the card in his system (all the same specs like my system except the PSU) and the coil whine was definitly less noisy.

Maybe the PSU is causing the coil whine but maybe my card is just a broken card.
I sended the card back for exchange but the coil whine was still the same.

So i investigated a little about coil whine and different PSU and came to the following conclusion:

**The more amp on the 12V rail, the less coil whine**

That was my theroy.

My old PSU got 19A on each 12V Rail
https://dl2.pushbulletusercontent.com/2mbI2W44JTmoG5msulwqrYGc2d8quRVJ/20170219_151620.jpg

Now it was time for testing.
i bought a new PSU:

* bequite! Pure Power 10 CM Silver

Relatively new PSU with 32A and 28A on each 12V rail
https://dl2.pushbulletusercontent.com/tfP9JWghP4vGHjZMNQrSWFF2UXXW7Gd2/20170219_151733.jpg

And the coil whine sound situation was a huge difference:
Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VXl3I-Yy90

In the video you cant here any coil whine, because it was so quite. WOW

The Question is:
Is my theory right?
could this be the final explanation for this old problem?

*btw: in both videos i used heaven benchmark for stressing the card*"

I really want to upgrade my GPU to MSI GTX 1070 Gaming X 8 GB.

I play ARK: Survival Evolved, Overwatch, BF4, BF1, Fallout 4, GTA V always at 1080P. But most of the time i'm playing ARK. As you know ARK has a very bad optimization at graphics. But the game is amazing and i always played it on lowest settings with my rig. I just want to play it with High-Epic settings at 1080P/60fps. Maybe in the future, i can buy a 144hz monitor. But at this moment i always play these games at 1080P resolution.


In the other hand, my work is about mostly editing 1080P (sometimes 4K) videos on Premiere &amp; After Effects, editing photos with Lightroom &amp; Photoshop.


So if i buy that GTX 1070 to this rig, what will be pros and cons? (Seperately for gaming and video editing) Are my CPU, PSU and Motherboard will be okay with GTX 1070's optimal performance? If not, how it affects FPS while playing a well-optimized game like GTA V on 1080P? (I'm not even asking ARK :)) 
I have a nice CPU Cooler. Should I try to OC my FX-8320 when i get the GTX 1070? Will it change anything? Or is my PSU okay with that?

PS: Changing CPU to Intel is not on the table for me. Not in 2 years. After then i will go for Intel CPU, new motherboard and DDR4 rams."

Some say they are the same thing. Some say they are for VR. Some say they lighten the load on old processors. 

I know I've got performance increases and less input lag in FPS games in the past by lowering maximum pre-rendered frames to 1 to the point that it's become my go to tweak for a game that is running poorly or has input lag. 

However, some in a CS GO thread about these same settings (which ultimately seemed inconclusive but had many posts of people's personal experiences claiming they felt they could aim better/faster and that their FPS rose by almost 50% in some cases. While some others claimed it increased input delay. Others said it was solely a setting for VR gaming.

1x 128GB where I keep the games that I play at the moment.

I just realized that on my 250GB SSD, the Windows one I have 20.7 TB written. That's in almost 2 years. I didn't believe it because I don't use that drive for pretty much anything except Windows and some small apps.

Didn't know what the culprit was so after I scratched my head a couple of times I remembered that I have Instant Replay enabled on Shadowplay. It is set to 5minutes. 

I don't record that much, I kept it on only when I found something funny while playing games. I also don't do youtube videos.

So far I think the culprit is the Instant Replay because I think it's constantly recording the last 5minutes and since my PC is on pretty much all the time, I guess it keeps writing....

I just disabled Instant Replay...:)

I've been having trouble with my GTX970:s GPU-usage never going past 40-50% (30 fps in Red Orchestra 2) in various games (e.g. Red Orchestra 2, WoW, Metro 2033 etc).

However, if I have a GPU-heavy application such as Heaven Benchmark or 3D Mark running while I start the game and then turn it off while GPU-usage is at 100%, it will remain at 80-90% (100 fps in Red Orchestra 2) instead of 40-50% while in-game.

Leaving the benchmark on while playing results in a very low frame rate around 10-20 fps in the same game. Is there a reason for the GPU not reaching this performance by itself without the work-around?

And what if I turn on both G-SYNC and V-SYNC in control painel? FPS will be capped at 144FPS, but it will use G-SYNC or V-SYNC inside 144FPS limit?

And if I limit the framerate to 142FPS via Rivaturner with G-SYNC on and V-SYNC OFF, it will be ok?

Nvidia really need to explain how this technology works, I want to use it RIGHT, I dont need more than 144FPS

Thanks!"

nvidia,lukeman3000,7,0,"I haven't played Gears 4 for probably a bit over a month now, due to a graphical glitch which seems to be tied to G-Sync. Details insideEver since a certain update (of either the game or my graphics driver), it seems as if G-Sync support has been completely messed up in this game. Every time I play, [this is what I'm met with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79vaxStmJk4).

Needless to say, it's not very fun playing with flashing lines on your screen, so I have abstained from playing until the problem was fixed, presumably in the near future as this seemed, to me, to be a pretty major issue.

Apparently not, as it has not been fixed [since I first posted about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/5b0jx9/turning_vsync_off_results_in_black_lines_on_the/), about 1 month ago.

What gives? Is anyone aware of this problem? Does anyone care? I can sort of fix the issue by using the in-game FPS cap and setting it to 90, but I don't want to do that because I want to be able to take advantage of higher FPS (I have a 144Hz monitor, after all).

Will this ever be fixed, or did I waste $60? Do I have any recourse in getting a refund from the Windows store at this point?"

Also can the titan handle 1440 ultra on most games. I play mostly everything from story driven triple A games to fps games like csgo. So I really do the whole cycle when it comes to gaming. Also one last question, I'm a pretty heavy gamer and as previously stated I play mostly every type of game so my final question is would the 144hz be good if I'm playing all types of games and not only fps games.

nvidia,azerius94,3,1,"Is the 970M worth it?Hey /r/nvidia,

I'm currently in the thoughts of buying a new laptop in the very near future. I currently have my eyes on a laptop that was uses the 970M graphics card.

Whilst I am aware that newer and cards exist such as the 1060 and the 1070, my question is whether or not the 970M would be a solid purchase considering its age. I should also mention I do not play overly intensive games, but stick to games such as WoW. Other games would include GTA V, The Forest, No Man's Sky (yes, yes, I know) and Ark: Survival Evolved.

The reason I am not opting for the later series is due to ficial issues and that local laptops are very expensive, where a local 1060 laptop goes for 1.6k here and 1.2k online. (I also try to avoid laptops online due to no warranty). I also cannot wait to save up due to the urgency of a new laptop (current one is falling apart, need it to work).

**Operating System &amp; Version:** Windows 10 64 bit

**GPU Drivers:** 376.33, clean install

**Description of Problem:** I'd like to start off by saying this is not 100% replicable problem. It happens ~70% of the times.

Scenario (gaming):
- Card acts normally with no, or low level of fans spinning
- Card reaches higher stress levels, usually has around 50-60C temp
- Suddenly coolling system produces a lot of noise

When you look at the card only one fan is spinning (at 100%), 2nd is idle. If you kill the game and look at GPU load and temps it goes down to 0% and ~30C. Still only one fan at 100% speed.

GPU-Z shows fans at 0RPM, also you can't control them manually via MSI Afterburner at this point.

The only thing that works is giving the idle fan a little push. Then it starts spinning and whole systems slows down and usually stops since there is no load at the moment. If I do this ""jump start"" when playing a game it just levels the RPM at around 40-60% with both fans and normal noise.

At this point you can see the readings on GPU-Z.

**Troubleshooting:** I tried replicating this inside MSI Afterburner on manual. Setting fans to 100% and 0% multiple times. Worked everytime, no problems with only one fan spinning. This makes me believe it isn't hardware problem.

Reinstalled drivers but didn't help. Currently 376.33.

nvidia,Aurifort,19,3,"Feeling really offput as a customer by EVGA service (or how my 770 repair could be more expensive than a 1050 replacement)Not sure if this is the right place, but man, so much for legendary EVGA support.  Originally when I bought my 770GTX in '13, I took a little too long to register the card and was denied the opportunity for an upgrade.  That left a very sour taste in my mouth (hello, free extra money?) but I understood that one.

Yesterday a fan fell off the ACX cooler.  That's strange to me since I have (literal) 15 year old GPUs on their original HSF with working fans, but hey, shit happens.  Whatever.  I contact EVGA support, and I'm told in no uncertain terms that I'll have to ship the card at my cost both ways, it'll be a minimum of $65 (an hour, charged an hour upfront) to 'diagnose' the card, and then I'm not promised the device back because replacement coolers aren't avaiable at this time.

I wasn't expecting a freebie or magic wand, but let's be reasonable here.  $65+let's say 20 for shipping in a decent container, plus whatever EVGA charges to send it back. (I'll be nice and say $20 as well.)  To have someone at EVGA look at it (again, a fan fell off) would cost me a minimum of ~$105 before they shipped it back and assuming their fan experts can determine the issue within that first upfront hour.  For $5 I could buy [a 1050](https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-GeForce-Support-02G-P4-6152-KR-Rodgers/dp/B01M64G435/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1482272327&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=GTX+1050) to hold me over until the 11 series or the 10 series refresh.  I get that stuff fails, but come on EVGA.  Your quoted price is within reason to buy a fucking sidegrade - a 1050.  

I'm also appreciating the irony that the 780 I wanted to upgrade to was the reference cooler design.  If I could've paid the extra ~$100 difference to go from my 770 to a 780, this likely wouldn't be an issue.

I get that this is petty to bitch about, but $85 to determine if a fan was broken... grow up EVGA.  

I expected better of you.


(For the record the card is fine and no heat related damage.  The other fan was working and while my ambient temps were up, overall the card was still in the mid 70s under load.  I just wanted to purchase a replacement fan or cooler, not spend $85 minimum to have an engineer agree with my assessment.)"

Happens on youtube and twitch every time I go full screen. The new card is also being buggy in general, for example with my old R9 390 I can alt+tab out of a game, watch a video, and re-enter the game no problem. With this new GTX 1080 I can't watch online videos if there's a game running.

Troubleshooting: I did the clean driver install in custom install 4 times to no avail. The fuzzy text is actually unreadable and for now my temporary solution is to plug-unplug the HDMI cable and everything goes back to normal. "

nvidia,rtech-,0,0,"[HELP]Geforce Experience/shadowplay issue.Hello and merry christmas everyone! 

(except me ofc)

So i have been using Fraps/dxtory/obs and shadowplay for my recording purposes, shadowplay was the best software when i had my old nvidia gpu before changing to amd one aand now i switched back to nvidia after my amd card died. 

So i decided to start looking for a program to star recording again, i mainly play world of warcraft and im the one on our team who records the kill videos for our youtube channel. 

Well, tonight i decided to start using shadowplay again, ok should not be a big deal.
 
After installing and restarting my pc i used the geforce to optimize my game so the program would idealy work fine and i setupped my keybinds so i could access the menu in game. 

Enabled sharing function and set my recording to in game and pressed record, except nothing happened ? 

Tried again and again and nothing happens at all, tried switching from ingame to 1080p and nothing worked still, made sure that the geforce optimized the game properly and the game was runnin in fullscreen and the software was working as intended from that. 

(Note that i have 950gpu)

After that i decided to check the drivers tab on the geforce window, ooh, i have an update. Did that and the software crit errored and i wasnt able to re open the software so i decided to re instal it, after restarting my pc ofc since i had to remove the left over files. 

After that i restarted my pc again after re installing the geforce experience and long behold my battlenet program didnt open anymore, skype was corrupted, and i got email notification to my phone that there were 2 different ip's trying to login to my gmail account that i used to login to my geforce experience. 

Now, all i wanted to do was record my world of warcraft gameplay without any significant frame drops in video and i tought that shadowplay was a great option for it, but turns out i wasnt able to record at all and my google account allmost got snatched at the same time. . . + i had to reinstall battlenet aswell since the shadowplay somehow corrupted it. 

So any ideas how i can get my shadowplay to work, basically nothing i have tried to do worked so far, oh and i tried changing my wow client to 32bit and change my windows theme to the default aero but those didnt work.

Or is there any other alternatives to shadowplay, i would gladly take any other program that i could use to record my gameplay without losing gameplay fps too much and the recording wont have too big of a frame drops either.

Thank you!

(PS! I'm terribly sorry if there are too much typos, english is not my native language and im hella tired after all this and its 3am and i have been struggling all night to get this working. . .)"

GPU Drivers: 376.33 clean install

Description of Problem: Where do I start... this laptop is about 3 months old. I've been having no problems with it as far as the GPU goes (other than it runs hotter than I'd like sometimes, but still within acceptable temps). Then suddenly a few days ago while playing Rocket League, I got a TDR error. Didn't think anything of it at first. They happen sometimes. Then it happened again within 20 min. Then again soon after and crashed my game. So I did a clean install of 376.33 (not sure what I had before) using DDU and nothing changed. I then tried the registry edit TdrDelay fix and the problem then changed so that I now get the windows notification saying ""application has been blocked from accessing Graphics hardware. Application (Program.exe) has been blocked from accessing graphics hardware."" and the game basically crashes. Before it wasn't guaranteed the game would crash and I could resume playing once things got back up, but with the regedit fix it crashes every time. Somewhere in here I even got a couple blue screens as well but I don't remember if that was before or after the regedit fix.  These are the errors that show up in event viewer. 

[Example 1](https://gyazo.com/2d535b3bc8aebbad63d4a2a4e4405562)

[Example 2](https://gyazo.com/e035a3c6b48b2f11910f7095c10775cc)

I was trying to think what might have changed to make this error happen. I hadn't updated GPU drivers in at least a few weeks or installed anything new. So I tried restoring Windows to a restore point from 12/13 made during a Windows update. It didn't help and it also undid my update to 376.33. So I undid that rollback. After trying a laundry list of things (that I will list below) I haven't found a solution and have since also had the error happen for google chrome and for FurMark, which I was installing just to see what would happen if I stress test the GPU. FurMark would crash immediately every time I started a test, and I got 2 new errors in event viewer to go along with the 2 old errors.

[New Error 1](https://gyazo.com/c087891a6de6f3b3311875a9210f81d2)

[New Error 2](https://gyazo.com/8b0d4322ad0489b531e5dd45b2d6689e) 

Oh and also I tried playing Overwatch for a while to see if it happened in other games, but no luck. I think I got a TDR in Hearthstone earlier in the day before this all went down but haven't gotten another with it either. I'm starting to wonder if I need to contact xoticpc or sager and start considering an RMA on the GPU. 

Troubleshooting: I'll try and list everything I've done here over the last few days, hopefully I don't forget anything.

All Windows updates done.

Updated to 376.33 WHQL

Installed older drivers listed on sager's page (in case of compatibility issues)

rolled back to older drivers (when I rolled back Windows)

Fresh installed 376.33

Turned off DVR in the xbox window in Win 10

Used the regedit fix for TdrDelay and TdrDdiDelay (set to 20)

Tried underclocking my GPU by 200mHz (I don't mess with overclocking ever but I saw this mentioned in multiple places so I tried it and thought it worked but got another crash after 20-30 min)

&amp;nbsp;

**The ReadMe**

This requires 7zip to be installed (or at least 7z.exe somewhere on your pc). You need to set %path_7z% (line 3) to suit your 7z.exe location.

You probably want to set %link% (line 4) to suit your country. So for the US you would just change 'uk' to 'us'.

When you start the batch file:

- you enter the driver version, e.g: 376.33

- it will then download the driver to %temp%, i.e: C:\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp

- extract only the folders listed in the 7zip line (line 7) to a folder (with the driver version as the name) where the batch file is located.

- delete the driver exe from %temp% 

- then clean install the driver silently without restarting. 

It is set here so only the bare minimum is extracted, you need to add other folders to the 7zip line if you want Optimus, GFE, Telemetry etc.

The download part won't work with all driver versions as the link syntax can change with any driver version. 

This is just a guide really, customise it as you see fit. For example, you can separate parts of this into different batch files, in case you wanted only to download and extract, then install later."

Issues: 

Hi all, recently upgraded from a 660ti to the 1060, and I've been very disappointed with it's performance, I'm not coming close to the benchmarks I've seen. I've used MSI afterburner and GPU-z to monitor my performance in the witcher 3 and crysis 3. Links below

I've noticed that my fps drops coincide with low GPU usage and very high cpu usage, with one or two cores at 100%. Also, GPU-z gives Vrel (voltage reliability) &amp; pwr (power limit) as reasons for reaching performance capacity. 

Lastly, I'm somewhat of a novice to this sort of thing and I'm confused about my core clock speed. According to the specs for my card, the base card speed is about 1500mhz, yet whenever I play its sitting around 1800mhz. Does this mean my card is overclocked? I'm just wondering what input from me would cause it to do this. The only thing I've changed is the power management mode from ""optimal power"" to ""adaptive"". Any advice on what I should do to improve my performance would be much appreciated. "

Read this thread if you haven't.

EVGA is offering multiples things for this

**Option #1** - You request the thermal pads and they give you the pads, paste, and instructions on how to apply they. 

They fully cover you if you do this, even if you manage to cause physical damage to the card, you are still 100% covered via warranty, and taking the graphics card apart never voided warranty in the first place for EVGA.

**Option #2** - You can request an advanced RMA. 

They will put a hold on a debit or credit card for the cards amount and send you a card that already has the fixes applied. You will receive the new card and then you can ship your old one back at that time in the same box. They may or may not be paying for return shipping from what I've seen, but normally with advanced rma's they also cover shipping.


**I feel like not alot of people know about option 2, but they are indeed offering advanced RMA's, and they have confirmed this twice in other areas.**

EVGA's biggest mess-up here is the issue happening in the first place, and then saying the fixes are optional, but they are providing adequate ways to resolve the issue. An advanced RMA is pretty much the gold standard these days and the best thing you can get.

It is not optional, you need to apply the pads, or you need them to send you a card with the pads applied. From what we've seen from people testing and videos like the ones from Gamers Nexus, once they are applied the temperatures are fine. "

Now I've already initiated an RMA of this GPU, but what I can't understand is why it would go x1 in one computer and x2 in another.

I've done multiple re-seatings of the card and flashed/restored both the mobo BIOS and the GPU firmware.

I've read about GPU Boost 3.0 that does the throttling, but I don't think it impacts the number of lanes being used? Can other things like PSU affect the number of lanes?"

**Description of Problem:** 

So I posted a thread on the Chrome side of Reddit about this, and after a full reinstall , opening Youtube vids after restoring all my programs and drivers one by one...lo and behold, it's the Nvidia driver that's responsible.
 

The very specific problem; When I have a Chrome window fullscreen on my second monitor and attempt to fullscreen a video (Twitch, Facebook, Youtube), there is a border along the top and left side of the video that shows whatever's open behind. It's like the video is...almost dragged off the screen a bit. 


Pictures explain it better: https://puu.sh/sebMz/58cbac70ab.jpg


See that green in the top? That's my Chrome tabs. Whenever I fullscreen a video in a ** *FULLSCREEN* CHROME WINDOW** this happens. If I don't maximize the Chrome window, the videos fullscreens without the border issue. SUCH a strange issue, but now I know where to point the finger, and hopefully someone here can help point *ME* toward a fix. :)

Here is my thread from the Chrome subreddit, it's fairly concise. Much more concise than my recap here: https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/5c4vrk/youtube_twitch_other_videos_not_actually/

Edit: While I see this issue on my right-hand monitor, which to me is my *second* monitor, the monitor is actually listed as the *first* monitor in display settings: http://puu.sh/som3z/2f9eb5b665.png

It is the right-hand monitor that is having this struggle. 



**Troubleshooting:** To recap the other thread:

-I've disabled hardware acceleration in Chrome.

-I've disabled Flash Player from Chrome://plugins.

-I've disabled all extensions.

-I've ensured Chrome is up-to-date.

-I've used Magic Actions (a Chrome extension) to flip Youtube between the Flash &amp; HTML5 player. 

*-Note that I had all extensions loaded up BEFORE installing 375.95 (and before that, 372.70) and videos were fullscreening fine. I don't believe Chrome alone is to blame, and I don't believe any of my extensions are to blame. *

-I've reinstalled Chrome.

-I've reinstalled drivers, even going as far as using DDU to purge my system of all traces of Nvidia drivers.

--I've reinstalled WINDOWS 10 at which point it worked fine.

--Reinstalled Chrome, worked fine.

--Reinstalled all my extensions one by one, worked fine.

nvidia,twigg89,4,0,"Just picked up a GTX 1080 FE, wan't some beginner's adviceLong story short I picked it up for 449.99 after a BestBuy error. This will be my first Nvidia card in many years and the first time I've owned a top of the line graphics card. The main purpose of this card was to be able to run 1440p 144hz without issue for years to run. I was hoping you guys could help me out with some basic stuff as I am not sure how to get the best out of my new card.

1). The Nvidia experience is a lot more encompassing than AMD's Crimson and out the gate it can be pretty annoying. How do I get it to calm down a bit, particularly regarding the in game recorder which pops up every time I start a game.

2). I want to get a Gsync monitor but they all seem pretty expensive. [This](http://www.dell.com/en-us/member/shop/dell-27-gaming-monitor-s2716dg/apd/210-agjr/monitors-flat-panel-widescreen)  seems like the best deal at the moment but this will be the first time spending so much on a monitor so I wanted to know if there were less obvious details/spec/issues that I should be aware of before I pull the trigger.

3). I have this strange boot issue where my main monitor (which is connected via HDMI) won't display anything until I get to the windows screen. My secondary monitor (connected via DVI) will show the whole process. This was not an issue with my 390 and it is a little worrying. Is this indicative of a hardware issue with my card or is there a setting that oversees this? The secondary monitor will be replaced when I purchase my Gsync monitor and I am a little worried that that monitor (most likely connected via DisplayPort) will have the same issue).

4). Literally anything else. What kind of benchmarks should I be seeing? What kind of temperatures are normal? Are there particular games that really show the qualities of this new card? So far I've played Rocket League, Football manager, and Overwatch so I haven't really pushed this thing."

Just thought I'd share this as a heads up for anyone who is uncomfortable with removing the card heatsink for the VRAM pad installation. Unfortunately I guess there's no way to know for certain unless you take the card apart and have a look but at least it seems it's not 100% an issue on every card.

But I was wondering if anybody could share their experiences with Gamestream Co-op or Moonlight to give me a realistic expectation of what I'll be able to manage.

- Has anybody played with somebody over the internet long-distance? I'm from US East, and a good friend of mine is in the UK. Would it be possible to play certain slower games together? I'm thinking XCOM, FTL mostly, but also would like to try Gungeon and Isaac.

- What kind of latency can I expect with 30mb/s down and 6mb/s up? I'll be the one hosting, probably at 720. I'll also be playing with people I know in real life (same town), people a few states off (east coast) and people across the country (west coast), so not only with my friend in the UK.

- Any miscellaneous experiences anybody can share in regards to quality/latency? This is a surprisingly hard thing to find impressions of when googling.

Overall this is a feature I'm looking forward to and one I actually plan to use a fair bit if possible, so I'm just hoping somebody who has used it a bit can give me ideas on what I should expect.

nvidia,xEnzo,3,1,"G-Sync at 144+ FPS and Input LagI've been reading some posts about input lag and G-SYNC in this subreddit, but they were from a year ago. I did not know that above 144 FPS would actually increase input lag on a G-SYNC monitor. At least that's what it looks like from what I've read? Has anything changed with my kind of monitor (144hz G-SYNC) in the past year? 

I'd also like to know if disabling G-SYNC completely (what I'm doing now) and V-Sync is the best way to remove input lag. I play Overwatch competitively and my current setup has been to run it at 300 FPS because most say the higher the FPS, the lower the input lag...even if your monitor can't display 300 FPS. So, why does a G-SYNC monitor revert to using V-Sync if it goes above 144FPS? I have both G-SYNC and V-Sync disabled in my Nvidia Control Panel Global Settings. Is V-Sync somehow still enabling itself once I reach 145+ FPS? What's the best solution here for me to reach the lowest input lag possible?

One other tiny problem I'm having with G-SYNC is that despite only disabling it for Overwatch.exe in the Nvidia Control Panel, it completely disables it for all games. Despite having G-SYNC enabled in my global settings, it still has it disabled everywhere and in order to enable G-SYNC evverywhere I have to enable it for Overwatch.exe"
nvidia,LefterisFred,75,81,"GTX 1070 FTW bunch of fkn problems, not just fire.Warning before reading: I'm from Greece, so excuse my bad English in advance.

About 2 months ago I bought myself a new gaming rig, payed ~1500 Euros for this (~1600 USD).
The card of my choise was EVGA GTX 1070 FTW, and God am I starting to regret this..
A summary timeline of my problems:

1st: I noticed that my card's fans were always spinning. Not above 60 degrees Celsius, not under heavy load. ALWAYS. I double checked the Fan Profiles in the EVGA Presicion XOC, I switched between Primary and Secondary BIOS and the problem insisted. So I contacted customer service. Guys there told me that it's probably a faulty fan controler and offered an RMA, but in the same time they told me it's nothing to worry about as this won't affect my card's lifetime, or performance etc. So I declined the RMA offer because it would take a bunch of time. Here, I feel the need to tell that their customer service is indeed excellent.

2nd problem: Moving forward about a week and I experience unrecoverable Black Screens when trying to exit or Alt-Tab from GTA V. Only a hard reset could fix this. Sounds behind the black screen (like Facebook bleeps) would keep on playing. I furthermore noticed some microstutters and FPS drops when I was playing the game. This should be a thing with my rig I think. I also have some screen tearing in some Youtube videos, but maybe this is because of my screen or some bad cameras, I don't really know.

3rd: The VRM and VRAM temperatures we all know about. Please notice that I contacted EVGA again and they told me not to worry about, and that the solutions they're offering are optional and also that I wouldnt run into any problems.

4th and this is where I want you to mainly focus: Just some minutes ago, I thought what the hell, I might as well update my card's BIOS profiles. Better safe than sorry. So I go into their forum where the downloadable files are and I see that there are 2 different updates for each of the BIOS, one for primary and one for secondary, and that my card should be switched to the BIOS flashed. Then I go into Nvidia's Panel to see the secondary BIOS number (86.04.26.01.70), turn off my PC, switch to the primary one, bring up Nvidia's Control Panel again, and what number do I see? 86.04.26.01.70. The 2 bios numbers are the same. And I'm like wtf. As far as I know the primary's Bios number should be 86.04.26.00.70. How is this possible, that 2 different BIOS have the same BIOS number.

Is it possible that my card is THAT faulty? And what should I do?"

PLEASE NOTE - I DO NOT want the latest GFE that requires registration and personal information and attempts to reinstall an older version fail with a vague statement about Windows NET Framework 4 - it just says FAIL.

Description of Problem: Good Day. This is a very familiar problem from my research, I can seem to find a work around for the issue. I have a dual Monitor setup and and my graphics cards are in SLI Configuration. I would like to play the MMORPG Black Desert Online Which has mode of Fullscreen, Borderless Fullscreen, and Windowed. Simply put the game gets ~120 FPS Fullscreen and 60 Borderless. I would love the play in Fullscreen except you lose multi-monitor functionality. Tools such as Display Fushion’s Window Focus function keep the game in full screen, but remove the ability to perform input into the game. Has anyone come across a solution to such an issue

In my opinion it is a great card for 1080 @ 144hz on ultra settings for demanding games. There is just one issue that has been driving me nuts for the last four months...

Whenever I'm not gaming, the screen would flicker quite often when the monitor is set to 144hz. On the desktop, flickering. Browsing reddit, flickering. Opening Excel... flickering. It was so annoying. My fix was to set my monitor to 120hz. I would try to set it back to 144hz to get the full benefit while gaming but would often forget.

I've clean installed almost every new driver since I purchased the card in hopes this would be fixed. Finally with the newest driver (375.95) fixed it.

nvidia,Sele81,7,0,"I can´t install Nvidia drivers, getting an error message all the time (1070 GTX)Hi,

I have a problem with the new Nvidia drivers. When I try to install the Nvidia driver, my PC freezes, I get strange movements and pixels on the screen, then a blackscreen and then windows 10 says that the driver could not be installed and that windows fixed the problem and recreated the display back again. I get the message in german so I can´t really translate this. I got this error message withe the last drivers too.

But still Nvidia shows me that the 375.95 driver is installed. I am not sure if that is the case now? Or are there problems?

I uninstalled everything with DDU already and reinstalled the driver from scratch. Same problem happens every time.

I did an Windows 10 update 2 weeks ago where my pc freezed and windows could not get started anymore. So I uninstalled these Win10 updates and since then the PC has become pretty strange. When I boot Win 10 I get a black screen for 30 seconds and then Windows shows the Desktop. I´ve read that this might be a problem with the Monitor driver but I have an iIyama Monitor and there are no drivers for it. I also have the Oculus Rift and an 2nd Samsung Monitor connected to the GFX card. But the Samsung is not in use.

Does somebody know what could be the problem here?

nvidia,Dawsonpc14,1,1,"Proper way to code in EDID override on new Nvidia drivers?Hey everyone, I have had a 24 inch Westinghouse monitor for 9 years now. Still going strong too! Unfortunately for me, and thousands of others, anytime I update drivers I have to manually code in EDID overrides. This has led me to 1.) rarely ever update drivers and 2.) use it as my secondary monitor.

With that said, I haven't done it in probably a year and I recently had to start over fresh on a reformat of my main HDD. The last time I did it I remember it took me a couple of hours to finally figure out where to put in the line of code to get the monitor to not look all fuzzy and washed out. This go around, anytime I add the code in it fails to install about 30 secs into the process. So I must be putting it in the wrong place. The typical places you used to put these were:

[nv_SoftwareDeviceSettings]

[nv_SoftwareDeviceSettings_GTxx]

[nv_commonBase_addreg]

[nv_commonBase_addreg__01]

[nv_commonBase_addreg__02]


Now those headers mostly don't exist, and the common base ones seems to make the install fail. Would anyone know the exact spots I need to throw the EDID code in for the newer drivers and the right file? the nv4_disp.inf doesn't exist anymore either.

nvidia,u_int16,30,42,"Avoid Geforce Experience 3.0 without tedium or side-effects.Greetings,  
&amp;nbsp;  
I came to this subreddit to find out about GeForce experience 3.0 and how to avoid it. I have seen some solutions, some workarounds, but mostly I did not feel like they provided a simple way and some explanation to what youre doing. I seek to do just that, in one comprehensive post. Let me be clear, GeForce experience 3.X is significantly better performance-wise. Opting to stay on 2.X is a personal choice that is not mine to criticize.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**The Problem**  
[Release Post](https://ts.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/51z342/geforce_experience_30_info/)  
NVidia's GeForce experience 3 released. It automatically updates from 2.X and the update is seemingly unavoidable. 3.X is undesirable to some because it requires an account to use. There are some other UI/UX complaints but the login seems to be the source of the most contention.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**The Workarounds, and why I wouldnt use some of them**  
1. *[Just Uninstall It](https://ts.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/51p049/having_to_make_an_account_for_geforce_experience/d7dz1ym/)*  
Sure. Yes. This avoids the problem. However, some people use the [features of GeForce experience](https://ts.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/51p049/having_to_make_an_account_for_geforce_experience/d7e3aj6/), and would rather avoid this. There are workarounds for features such as the LED Visualizer, if you prefer that, thats fine. For me, this was not an option. This is not hard, so I wont waste your time with a guide on uninstalling. Shadowplay Workaround: [HERE](https://ts.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/51p049/having_to_make_an_account_for_geforce_experience/d7edd8g/)  
2. *[Just uninstall it AND re-install 2.X](https://ts.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/51z342/geforce_experience_30_info/d7inw3i/)*  
This does not work. Unfortunately, NVidia have made it such that once you open GeForce experience 2.0, it will try to update. Refuse and it will not run. There are a billion workarounds to this. They all involve some tedious interactions like for example: Leave the update window open and then re-open gfe (i lost the permalink to this, sorry).  
3. *[Edit your hosts to prevent NVidia from getting updates](https://m.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/53wg81/how_to_revert_geforce_experience_version/d7wv5bv)*  
Look. I dont know what else NVidia uses that address for, these are the side effects (*[A](https://np.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/54kl5e/geforce_experience_30/d83siv2/)* *[B](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/520i7i/nvidia_forcing_me_to_upgrade_to_gfe_30_cannot/d8m07e8/)*) I mentioned prior. Furthermore, you cant use the tray to open GFE, which is more tedium, which is not what I am about.  
4. *[Remove the update](https://np.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/54kl5e/geforce_experience_30/d83z0vl/)*  
You have to do this. Every. Time. Next.  
5. *[Overly complex stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/520i7i/nvidia_forcing_me_to_upgrade_to_gfe_30_cannot/d7vcae6/)*  
**Avoid.** *Update: the author of this solution has edited it and it is now significantly simpler, I am not certain if it has side effects, but he seems to know what he is doing so, something to consider. Thanks [pantsuonegai](https://www.reddit.com/user/pantsuonegai)*  
&amp;nbsp;  
**Solution**  
GFE places the update here `C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\GeForce Experience\Update\Setup.exe`. In order to avoid it re-downloading it, you can make the download conflict. There are a few solutions with this suggestion floating about: [Mess up the folder](https://np.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/54kl5e/geforce_experience_30/d842q88/), [Replace the folder](https://ts.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/51z342/geforce_experience_30_info/d8rgce0/).  

These work perfectly fine. However, I dont know what other things NVidia uses that folder for. *Likely nothing, but I am not certain, why touch the folder?* My suggestion is to simply replace `C:\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\GeForce Experience\Update\Setup.exe` (the file itself) with a empty text file which you have renamed `Setup.txt`. This makes it such that NVidia doesnt try to launch a Setup.exe, but still cannot override the Setup file that currently exists. I find it curious that even though the file has a different extension, a ""Setup.exe"" isnt downloaded. Alas, this ""error"" is something we are exploiting to strategically break GFE's updating mechanisms, so live and let live. My guess, for those curious, is that there is a disconnect between the code for update launching and update downloading. Update launching will only happen with an `.exe` file, and will not try to open a `.txt` (etc), however update downloading refuses to download anything on top of any file named `Setup`; this of course is guesswork on my part and could be completely misguided.  
&amp;nbsp;  
**TLDR**  
&amp;nbsp;  
`Uninstall 3.X and reinstall 2.X` (Look at bullet #2)  
`open command line`  
`chdir ""\ProgramData\NVIDIA Corporation\GeForce Experience\Update\""`  
`del Setup.exe`  
`echo ""FU GFE 3.0"" &gt; Setup.txt`  
&amp;nbsp;

nvidia,TripleMonitorLatina,0,0,"Need help with my gaming rigHey Reddit, I hope you can help me out. I have a gaming rig with triple monitor setup and a GTX 970. Occasionally when I start Windows or reboot, one of my monitors that is connected to the DisplayPort reverts to 1280 X 960. I then have to manually go into the Nvidia control panel and switch it back to 1920 X 1080. Occasionally that resolution doesn't even show up and I end up unplugging/plugging back in the connection before Windows recognizes it. This isn't a consistent issue, which makes it so frustrating. Sometimes everything works, sometimes it goes to shit.

I've done the usual stuff, uninstalled/reinstalled the latest Nvidia drivers, reset Windows 10, etc. This only started occurring after one of those massive Windows updates that happened 2-3 weeks ago. Before it was fine. So I suspect that Windows 10 isn't playing nice with the graphics card, not the other way around. I've got the following specs:

Windows 10 home edition
GTX 970
Triple Monitor Setup (BenQ XL2720Z)

I know I could probably just use the HDMI output from the graphics card, but I'm using it for my HTC Vive.

Any ideas? I've scoured online forums but most posts are over a year old and they all say the same thing, i.e. reinstall drivers, blah blah blah.

Thanks in advance, Reddit. Hoping the community can provide me with some assistance so that I can get back into some Arma 3!

Peace.

nvidia,nVdiaquestion,3,0,"""NVIDIA Installer Cannot Continue"" Version 373.06So today I got Battlefield 1 and realized I hadn't installed the latest drivers when it said that I had to install Version 373.06 to play the game. I got my laptop (MSI GS73 6RF gtx 1060) about a month ago. I uninstalled the version I had (369.02) using DDU. Now when I try to install the new version, the installer says ""This graphics card driver is not compatible with this version of windows. This graphics card driver could not find any compatible graphics hardware."" I checked and I have Version 1511 of windows, which to my knowledge is compatible with that driver version.

nvidia,RomanianGypsy,3,0,"MSI GTX 970 4G awful performance after working perfectly for ~1year.**Status:** UNRESOLVED

**Computer Type:** Desktop

**GPU:** GTX 970 MSI 4G

**CPU:** i5 6600k

**Motherboard:** MSI Z170 Gaming M3

**RAM:** 8GB HyperX DDR4 2400Mhz

**PSU:** Seasonic M12II 620

**Operating System &amp; Version:** Windows 10, latest build, clean install

**GPU Drivers:** Latest / Older versions

**Description of Problem:** A week ago I was playing BF4 without worrying about the FPS (+130 constantly at least, not sure the exact number but everything was smooth). Over the course of the week I've gotten a Windows 10 update that installed successfully, and then was prompted to try the new GeForce Experience 3. Installed that one, updated the GPU drivers to the latest, and stupidly decided to 'optimize' BF4. I turn off my computer and the next day I notice something's 'off'. Chrome took just a few more ms to render, etc. 

I was hitting a bottleneck somewhere. I start BF4 and all the settings are maxed out and I have &lt;30 fps. I download afterburner and monitor what's going on. GPU load very low, CPU usage 100%. In task manager and resource monitor, the CPU is at ~30-40%, which makes me think the rest of the CPU goes toward processing video and maybe that doesn't show up in ResourceMon. 

I start League of Legends and the client (Adobe AIR) is acting very very badly. So yea, it seems like I have no GPU acceleration in Windows.

Changing settings from Low to Ultra doesn't seem to impact frame rate very much.

**Troubleshooting:** While testing in Battlefield 4 test range, I saw in Afterburner that I was hitting a Voltage max load, so I crank the OC just a little. This problem goes away, even after I reset OC values to normal.

Next I see that the memory core is at ~500 MHz. I unlock constant voltage in afterburner, and it goes to 3,500Mhz constantly. That's ok.

Next I try to see if my CPU is the problem. I get Intel XTU, run the benchmark and I get ~260 marks (is this normal ?) I overclock the CPU just a bit (to 4150 Mhz), and I get ~265 marks (again, normal?)

Same symptoms - low framerate, seemingly low GPU acceleration in Windows. 

I open nVidia control panel - set everything to max performance, disable power saving, try to get the most 'juice' out of it. I check Windwos power options - Max Performance too. 

I run DDU to uninstall drivers and install an older GPU driver without GeForce Experience - same problem.

I run a system restore to about a week ago (maybe the one before the update). Same problem. 

At this point I've tried everything and it seems like I have no Windows GPU acceleration. Games work like shit, in LoL I have ~100 fps but never go over 150. Which is something that my CPU alone could handle I think. But the GPU seems to be working, just not as good as before. It's clocks go up in games, temperature slowly raises from ~35-40 in idle to maybe 45-50. It's like it's got training weights on.

The only solution I have left is to try to format Windows and maybe go to an earlier build and hopefully it will solve itself, unless somebody comes up with a better suggestion.

Thanks in advance

# Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue** 

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that's if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are.

So in order for them to know what's going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](http://surveys.nvidia.com/index.jsp?pi=6e7ea6bb4a02641fa8f07694a40f8ac6) to Nvidia.

A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* If you are having issue installing the driver for GTX 1080/1070/1060 on Windows 10, make sure you are on the latest build 1511 (10586). If you are on the older build (e.g. 10240), you need to update your windows. Press Windows Key + R and type winver to check your build version.

* Please visit the following [Google Documents](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) for full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install. Thanks /u/GhostMotleyXT for the tutorial!!!

* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.

* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem. 

* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, please ask questions below or contact your manufacturers for an RMA.

# Common Questions

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days to ensure we do not get any fatal error such as the 364.47 bricking cards and if there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver. Alternatively, you can just use the “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” rule and stay at your current driver.* **Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and  you can always roll back if needed.**

* **Is Nvidia drivers going to cause my PC to explode/house to burn down/earth to explode?** *Probably not. Remember, our community is here is tiny in the grand scheme of thing. We are probably not even 5% of Nvidia user base world wide. Yes, there’s problems with any piece of software but for one people who has issues, there are many others who are using the latest drivers with no problem. This is why reporting your driver issue to Nvidia is extremely important for them to improve.*

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*

* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*

* **What does the new Power Management option ""Optimal Power"" means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people.

I checked ultrabookreview and it has a nice list, but most of their GTX 1060 laptops are non-starters for me.

I wonder if other companies are building laptops around 1060s? It seems like the current 1060 laptops are like ""refreshes"" of 970M variants (often with a slightler newer CPU) without any other real changes (eg cooling system, which is critical for d-GPU laptops).

nvidia,85218523,5,3,"Why hasn't NVIDIA introduced a driver lever frame limiter?So I recently got a G-Sync monitor and noticed I still get tearing in games! If you don't cap your frame rate and you bypass your top end g-sync range, you get tearing.

So, if your monitor has a 40-144hz g-sync range, and your fps goes above 144fps, you will get tearing. The solutions I've seen to this are to enable v-sync. What's the point of buying g-sync if you're forced to use v-sync? I bought G-Sync to avoid input lag and everyone is telling me this is the best option, to reintroduce the input lag! 

Why doesn't nvidia implement a frame limit option like EVGA has in their software Precision X software? Is it hard to implement?

Anyone know better methods to limiting your FPS without using V-Sync?"
nvidia,BoddAH86,18,9,"The Nintendo Switch is basically a new Nvidia Shield and that’s greatSo we know that the Nintendo Switch is powered by Nvidia technology. This may seem like a trivial bit of information (a simple switch from AMD to the competition for the GPU) but actually it may be very important or even critical because as you may know, Nvidia manufactures a product that is VERY similar to the Switch in essence.

The Nvidia Shield.

From the trailer and this simple comparison with the Nvidia Shield (technological innovation notwithstanding), we can gather a few very interesting bits regarding the Switch:


1.	It will probably have battery life similar to the Nvidia Shield, i.e. around 7 hours which is really not bad at all.

2.	It will have graphical performance similar to the Nvidia Shield. Not exactly on par with current gen consoles of the competition but not shabby at all for a tablet.

3.	It will probably have a touch screen and may very well be a very competent genera-purpose tablet for Netflix, Web browsing, etc. with a heavy emphasis on gaming and actual physical controls.

4.	This is huge: seeing it gets Skyrim and has a seemingly large amount of third-party developer support, it will probably have a pretty standard architecture (x86), like PC and other current-gen consoles, making development on the platform extremely easy.

5.	The price will probably be in the same ball park as the Nvidia Shield tablet i.e. $400 which makes sense for a new release console.


TL;DR the Nintendo Switch may very well basically be a new Nvidia Shield tablet made by (or in collaboration with) Nintendo. Which is great because the Nvidia Shield is a solid kit of hardware which was only crippled by a lack of games and credibility among gamers. With Nintendo’s catalogue and support this is obviously not a problem this time.
What do you think? Is your body ready for what could basically be a Nintendo iPad with physical controls?

After installing the 375.57 i carefully measured the frametimes with msi afterburner and they were consistent through-out my testing with no hitching whatsoever. And yes i have indeed completely disabled the Xbox game DVR way back when i first installed the anniversary update so that wasnt what was causing the high frametime spikes afterwards. And here i was about to revert to the old 1511 build because of these issues, id like to thank the Nvidia team for fixing this issue, you have no idea how much this was bugging me. "

I'm having problems with my GTX 1070 in my MSI GT62VR 6RE Laptop and I hope you have some solution I didn't try out yet.

So, my problems are that my driver crashes in Guild Wars 2 and Battlefield 1 almost instantly after loading a map.
After trying to build the driver up again, I need to restart my Laptop, because it doesn't work quite well after this crash.

Furthermore when I play Fallout 4 or SWTOR, I get my wanted 60 fps most of the time, but in some places, it falls down to 30 - 40, even though my CPU and GPU could handle this easily.

Sidenote: Even my dxdiag has problems with directshow and crashes if I don't want to skip it. Maybe it has something to do with the whole thing here.

I already tried 5 different driver versions - every driver deleted and installed with DDU. Right now I have the 375.57 driver installed.
The settings in the nvidia control panel are also set to maximum performance and to one display performance mode.

My memory type is Samsung, so this shouldn't be a problem... but I guess I'll try to install the new BIOS update for the MSI GTX 1070 anyways when it comes out.

I was wondering if any of you are having similar issues with the newest update. Ever since I updated the GeForce Experience the key shorcuts Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, and Ctrl+3 stopped working for me in any game (mainly WoW and LoL). 


Ctrl+4, Ctrl+5, Ctrl+6 etc work. Ctrl alone works, Ctrl+ any other key works. But Ctrl+1-3 do not work which are the ones I use the most.


I noticed that when I go into the GeForce settings and toggle Share off then my keybinds all go back to normal and I'm able to use Ctrl+1-3 again. So I've at least confirmed it is the Share feature causing issues.

This sucks because I really wanted to take advantage of the NVIDIA Share play to stream directly on Twitch but if I can't figure this out I'm going to be forced to go back to OBS.

I started noticing that I am getting Gsync tearing. I have a PG348Q and am using a Frame Limiter to keep the FPS under the monitor refresh rate (I tried at first 99 FPS as the monitor has a 100Hz refrsh rate, but I am now limited at 93 since it seems to have less tearing this way) - with Vsync off.

Now, I've been looking for answers and couldn't really figure out which was a true answer regarding Vsync (as there are a 100 posts that say Vsync needs to be off, while a 100 other posts that say that Gsync is here as an alternative to Vsync only without the frame limiting meaning it functions like Vsync until it hits more FPS than the refresh rate). I know in previous drivers, Vsync in the nvidia control panel had to be on. And also if Gsync was on, the FPS was automatically limited to the monitor refresh rate.

I tried rollbacking to the previous and I still get the tearing, so I am not quite sure when the problem started occurring, but I've started playing CS:GO again and its very apparent, and as it currently stands I need to choose between tearing or input lag.

I am running two GTX 1080s water cooled in SLI, so they are Gsync capable cards.

Anyone has has a problem with their Gsync lately, or is it just me? I believe disabling SLI does not fix the issue as well. 

So if anyone has any answers, regarding either Gsync and Vsync and/or Gsync tearing lately, I would appreciate it.

nvidia,vallentinester,16,0,"[Question]BQ 350W PSU will be enough to power GTX 1060 ?Hello.

My question is that, this power supply (Be Quiet 350W L8 with one PCI-E 6+2 pin ) will be sufficient to power gtx 1060 3Gb ?

My config:
i3 4330 + 2x4 Gb RAM, GT740, 1SSD, 1HDD 

I found reviews and test on the internet that suggest, GTX 1060 with rest components charge around 220-230W (with i7).

So I deduced that my PSU will work on ~70% of power.

Please correct me if i wrong.
Regards."

# Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue** 

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that's if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are.

So in order for them to know what's going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](http://surveys.nvidia.com/index.jsp?pi=6e7ea6bb4a02641fa8f07694a40f8ac6) to Nvidia.

A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* If you are having issue installing the driver for GTX 1080/1070/1060 on Windows 10, make sure you are on the latest build 1511 (10586). If you are on the older build (e.g. 10240), you need to update your windows. Press Windows Key + R and type winver to check your build version.

* Please visit the following [Google Documents](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) for full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install. Thanks /u/GhostMotleyXT for the tutorial!!!

* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.

* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem. 

* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, please ask questions below or contact your manufacturers for an RMA.

# Common Questions

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days to ensure we do not get any fatal error such as the 364.47 bricking cards and if there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver. Alternatively, you can just use the “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it” rule and stay at your current driver.* **Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and  you can always roll back if needed.**

* **Is Nvidia drivers going to cause my PC to explode/house to burn down/earth to explode?** *Probably not. Remember, our community is here is tiny in the grand scheme of thing. We are probably not even 5% of Nvidia user base world wide. Yes, there’s problems with any piece of software but for one people who has issues, there are many others who are using the latest drivers with no problem. This is why reporting your driver issue to Nvidia is extremely important for them to improve.*

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*

* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*

* **What does the new Power Management option ""Optimal Power"" means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people."

I'll be changing my current GTX 650 with [Asus GTX 1060](https://www.asus.com/Graphics-Cards/TURBO-GTX1060-6G/). This is my first GPU change, and after googling I still have some questions.  
So, procedure is:  
1. Turn on PC and uninstall current GPU drivers  
2. Turn off PC, pull out old GPU, install new one  
3. Turn on PC, install new drivers  
Pretty straight forward, but, what exactly do I uninstall? Some guides say to uninstall drivers from Control panel, [here](http://i.imgur.com/z1AUROh.png), while other say to uninstall GPU from Device manager, [here](http://i.imgur.com/nrRKroR.png).  
Which is it, or are they the same?  
Also, as you can see I have Nvidia PhysX installed and I honestly don't remember how that got installed. Did I install it manual, did it install with GPU drivers, or did it install with 3dsmax (which uses PhysX for some cloth operations). Question is, do I also uninstall it if it doesn't uninstall automatically with the drivers?

Another part of the problem is, what to install? Some guides say to install [Nvidia experience](http://i.imgur.com/0vuFCKf.png), and let it do it's thing. Other say not to install it, it's a piece of ""bloatware"" and to just install the [drivers them selves](http://i.imgur.com/XajRR0k.png).  
There is also the question of ASUS software that comes with the GPU. I know everyone say just toss it, but watching the reviews it offers some three modes of operating. Don't know, will I miss out on something if I don't install it?  
Thanks in advance!"

If not, what is the appeal of the 500GB model?"

As I usually do, I would like to record some benchmark videos comparing my previous card (GTX 970) to the new one side-by-side. Before installing the 1070 I recorded a few videos with Shadowplay on the 970. The FPS counter showed up on every single one--1080p tests, 1440p tests, DX11 tests, DX12 tests, no problem. But strangely the 1070 doesn't record the FPS counter at all. It displays fine in real-time but the video feed ignores it. This is true whether in DX11 or DX12 or whatever resolution. The only way I was able to get FPS to record in the video was to disable exclusive fullscreen mode in games that support it (like RotTR) but then the FPS reading is capped at the refresh rate, so that's no good.

Anyone else experiencing this, and is there a fix? Worst case scenario I could install Precision XOC or something but then I'd either have to deal with mismatching OSDs or hook up the 970 again, run Precision X, and re-record everything. I would rather not settle for either, if possible."

Since I'm within the first 30 days of owning the card I heard they will replace my card with a brand new OEM card rather than refurbished.

Do I need to buy that before I contact support for the RMA in order to use it or will they give me that option when I call them to start the RMA?

I was under the impression that it is kind of like insurance, you have to buy it before you need to use it, not when you do. Am I wrong?

of course the titan xp will be way more expensive. but it will perform slightly better. 980ti sli will probably be better in battlefield and tomb raider but overall txp will be more powerful but it should, costs way more.

another 980ti would be the easiest upgrade for me. i can do it now. cheaper. i dont have to try and sell my 980ti at a decent price. but i will have to upgrade my power supply from my current 750 to hopefully a decent 1000.

idk... instead of getting the titan i kinda feel sli could be more fun for now. i might upgrade when the 1080ti comes out... but probably not if its right around titan xp perf.  i probably will end up getting the 1180.

i know the problems sli has... idk how bad could it be? i supposed if too many games have below 20% perf increase it could suck. im gonna need a lot of performance for bf1 at 1440p 165hz. i will only game on my 4k tv for games that dont need great aim like combat games or games that work well with a controller. like gta 5 single player cuz of the auto aim. all competitive shooters will be on my acer predator.

And for example in nvidias pendulum Demo the mouse Lags extremly when the fps is at like 40 or below when using G-sync. By toggling v-sync or no Sync the lag vanishes. But maybe that is because I am accustumed to 144hz mouse movement haha.

**My question is:** Should the price (in Canada) come down anytime soon to be more in line with where our currency currently stands?"

nvidia,Newest-User,34,62,"The Mildly useful Pascal Overclocking post from some user on RedditPeople don't necessarily have to find OC'ing fun or easy, but it should be consistent once done right.
I'm going to help make that happen for you. Or waste seconds of your time trying. SECONDS!

Pascal has thermal throttling points, these points reduce your clock regardless of power or stability and have to be factored into your OC. 
These were also made more aggressive with driver 372.54, in turn making some peoples OC's unstable and even some memory OC's seemingly more prone to a crash.

After pushing all the power, temp and voltage nobs to 11 like [here](https://i.imgur.com/AzMgAMv.jpg), the best way to ensure stability in most cases, is to force a higher and consistent voltage.
As much as it pains me, an old school offset isn't good enough. It's all about those curves. Whatever the maximum voltage allowed by your card is, that's your priority.

My card allows [1.093v](https://i.imgur.com/2BWDt2a.jpg), so that is the number I will concentrate on. The principle is the same whatever the case. The best way to ensure you are hitting your maximum voltage, is a combination of the correct curve, aggressive fan profile and how often you have a margin in your power limit.


Tackling the [curve](https://i.imgur.com/JTn5GUx.jpg) first. You can manipulate the curve to give maximum voltage by setting your desired voltage and the voltage immediately above it to the same clock like [here](https://i.imgur.com/agiHf5I.jpg). Set every single clock [above](https://i.imgur.com/bKmRczN.jpg) that to the same clock, one bin higher (+13mhz) than your target and each voltage you can possibly hit [below](https://i.imgur.com/fHN1gEr.jpg) that to one bin lower (-13mhz) like here. But each lower bin should have a cumulatively lower bin.

This curve ensures the highest possible voltage allowance at all times. But the driver is more aggressive and every voltage under 1.06 I recommend only adding 50mhz max to it's offset, as you'll only be hitting these bins in loading screens and menus anyway, it just adds to failure points.

The [fan curve](https://i.imgur.com/lP5qnnp.jpg) can be subjective, I like quiet, but not disturbing me on headphones is my yardstick. In driver 372.54 (the GTX 1070 at least) thermally steps down from your target clock by one bin at ~54c. Ideally, you will allow your card to hover over 55c while finding your OC. Once found, you set your target OC on your voltage curve to one bin higher, (+13mhz), so when it exceeds 54c it levels out at your desired clock. This would mean designing your fan curve around a 54-62c window in a perfect world. To keep your clock locked. You can always target the next thermal step down in the lower 60's, but you will lose one speed bin.

The power target is out of your hands unless you use liquid metal on the PCB. This is why maxing the slider and having such tight bins under your target is so important, to reduce the drop off as much as possible.

This leaves your Memory to overclock. As with every other card, start somewhere with a 200mhz+ offset, (after finding your core OC of course) and add 25mhz+ to the memory in increments. Backing off with any artifacts or instability.

And that's it. That's some user on Reddit's tips for overclocking your Pascal card."

I was use Nvidia inspector to caps my FPS to 60.7FPS.
And then combine it with adaptive vsync/or vsync on.

Whenever I play games, Those will produce a very noticeable horizontal/Line tearing in the middle of your screen. 

Tested it in Witcher3,Left4dead2, AC4.

Best way possible if you want to caps your framerate &amp; remove tearing (also u dont have any gsync/freesync) is, Just use adaptive vsync, and thats it. Don't combine it with Frame limiter via software(im using nvidia inspector). However 'In-Game frame limiter' doesn't cause this.

also my other experiment, don't use Frame limiter with Fast-sync, it will cause stuttering all over the place (L4d2).

nvidia,Heavenswake_,5,0,"FPS stutter/judder in games but not benchmarks.I have been trying to figure this out for a long time now. I always thought this was an issue related to g-sync as I began noticing it after getting a g-sync monitor but I think it might be more of a CPU problem (really guessing here). Basically every game has a slight stutter/judder, if I run side to side and look at a lamp post it will occasionally twitch (every few seconds or so). It doesn't matter if my FPS is capped at 60, capped at 144, or varying (which g-sync is meant for). However doing the same thing in Unigine Valley there is no stutter/judder at all, regardless of FPS and everything is perfectly smooth. Which leads me to think maybe it's my CPU is the problem here.


* People have suggested to me that maybe my NCP settings are messed up, even changing them makes no difference and since it works fine in benchmarks it should work fine in games, no?

* I can confirm that g-sync is at least doing something, if I turn it off I get a constant stutter that never stops as opposed to just getting 1 stutter every couple of seconds.

* Trying different drivers doesn't solve the issue either, I must have tried at least 10 and it always happens in all games.

* I have my games installed on a SSD and even tried them on a different SSD which made no difference.

* I have replaced my RAM.

Is anyone successfully getting 5.1 sound in Windows 10 with their Nvidia HDMI audio? I'm running a GTX 1070 connected through HDMI to a 4K TV as well as a Pioneer receiver. Everything was working fine in Windows 7 but I just recently switched to Windows 10. In the new OS, I can no longer select 5.1 or 7.1 speaker configurations in the Playback properties. Instead my only option now is stereo. Has anyone experienced this? To be clear, this is about bit streaming when playing DTS or Dolby movies, but rather PCM surround sound in the OS itself as well as in games. 

Searched around the net but came up with no solution, any pointers would be appreciated.




**EDIT:** To clarify my setup, I have my graphics card plugged into the TV using the HDMI out, and then separately into the receiver using a DP-&gt;HDMI adapter from one of the DP out. I have it set up this way because my receiver cannot passthrough 4K video signal to my TV. I do not want to use optical out because optical cannot passthrough lossless audio. It was working perfectly back in Windows 7, now in windows 10 all I get is 2 channels.  In sound controls I have two playback devices, my TV and my receiver, however both only have the option for 2 channels."

This is a brand new build I put together this past weekend. After assembly, had my monitor plugged into the 1060's HDMI slot (not the onboard) and was able to install Windows, all other drivers, etc, and the display worked. When I installed the GeForce drivers, however, display kicked off. System still running because I am able to enter in short key commands and hear system sounds through the speakers. If I boot in safe mode, I get display again (still plugged into the 1060, however). If I then disable the 1060 in Device Manager, I can reboot normally with display.

Since this build is brand new, I have been unable to test another GPU as I don't have one laying around. That being said, I haven't been able to get the onboard graphics to work either (but this could be user error). I have tried a lot of different BIOS settings to the point where I don't think I could list everything I have tried. Setting the Primary Graphics from Auto to PEG or PCIE did not solve the issue, however. I am willing to retry any suggestion, however.

My current theories are:
A) GPU is dead or malfunctioning. If this is the case then somehow I am still able to get display when the card is disabled despite the monitor being connected to it. I'm not sure if this makes sense unless there is some sort of bypass function that gets turned off when the card's drivers are activated. This is pure speculation as I have no real way of testing it without getting another card, which I can do if necessary, I'm just trying to minimize the amount of $$ I need to spend in trying to track the issue down.

B) Motherboard malfunctioning. Really hoping this is not the case. If it is, all other peripherals are functioning fine, including display when the 1060 is disabled, so there would have to be some sort of very specific issue with the mobo's handling of graphics. I have tried the 1060 on both PCIe slots and neither worked.

Of course, it could be none of these things. I'm hoping for innocuous and simple. Hell, I'd even take difficult and obscure. I'd just like the machine to work :( I'm admittedly not the most knowledgable person on these things but I'm not an initiate either; just haven't done a custom build of my own in about 15 years so I'm way out of the game and after 3 days of solid Googling, I haven't been able to resolve the issue.

Is something wrong or is it a CPU bottleneck?I have an AMD fx-6350 which is a really crappy CPU but I always hear that CPU bottlenecks normally only lower your FPS by ~10 yet here I am playing Witcher 2 (on max settings) and it's pretty much unplayable. Turning ubersampling off makes the game run 30-50 so it's an improvement but not by much.

I do think it is a CPU bottleneck and not a problem with the GPU because I can play Doom on nightmare settings at 1440p and get 80-110 fps just fine and that game looks 10x better then Witcher 2. Maybe Witcher 2 just heavily relies on the CPU?

If my CPU is the problem it's not a big deal because I'm upgrading it in 1 1/2 months anyway, I'll just have to play something else (like Doom and Overwatch) while I'm waiting."

So I'm running on 2 monitors now, a Acer XB270HU Gsync monitor and a 21 inch HP monitor that I use for web browsing/video watching. What are the best/most optimal settings to put on the Nvidia Control Panel?  

My current settings are as follows:  
AO: off

Texture filtering - Negative LOD bias: Allow  
Texture filtering - Quality: High quality  
Threaded optimization: Auto  
Triple buffering: Off    
Vertical Sync: Off (I understand some people recommend this to be on)  
Virtual Reality pre-rendered frames: 1    

The current issues I face is for World of Warcraft frame rates are capped at 60 when in windowed borderless mode, but runs at 70+ to 80 when it's running in the background (i.e. when I'm surfing on my secondary monitor). Also some other issues with games as well where windowed borderless mode seems to have lower frame rates than fullscreen.

This is the first video card I've purchased since my Palit 9600GT Sonic. I'm clearly years behind, so my question are:

Gigabyte has the G1 Gaming and the D5. I got the D5, and I'm seeing that its core and boost modes are slightly less than the G1. Can both be overclocked freely? Or, due to the lower core and boost speeds, will the D5 never be able to overclock better than the G1?

I assumed you could get any AIB and overclock it however you want, but that must not be the case, or else they'd be priced the same, right?

&gt;it seems fishy that you just so happened to win ANOTHER contest after the first one was messed up. They never emailed you about winning this new one even though it seems to be an older competition than the video one. Seems they want to silence all the Gigabyte hate

After doing further research I came to find out that the previous contest was for Xtreme Gaming edition GPU not G1 Gaming, so why are they sending me a G1 Gaming? [Screenshot of the Xtreme Moments contest page stating winners will receive Xtreme Gaming edition GPUs not G1 Gaming](https://i.imgur.com/YotPP79.png)

- I wasn't contacted on June 15th nor was I contacted AFTER.

- I was told I won that contest literally the next month after gigabyte gets negative PR regarding another contest, if I didn't say anything I wouldn't have even known I won nor would I even have been told that I won something...

It gets even worse, I contacted the other winner of the video card and he said that he stated that he doesn't even know the winners were announced nor has he been contacted telling him he has won, he even said that it was all a lie and they've made fun of us. [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/mQIrVta.png)

I e-mailed /u/GBT_Van and sent him a Reddit msg 2 weeks ago regarding all this, I even asked if it's possible to get on a quick phone call - no replies to my correspondences even though he has been posting on Reddit, it's safe to assume that my correspondences are getting ignored. Gigabyte only seems to respond when they REALLY HAVE TO not when they are suppose to, it has been a nightmare trying to have proper dialogue with them to get this solved peacefully.

I believe I have been fair, very open and patient regarding this mess, while GIGABYTE has been fishy, deceitful, shady, etc. therefore at the moment I'm weighing my options and thinking of filing an FTC complaint against them regarding BOTH of the contests, I have clear evidence and that seems like the only way to get this shit fixed.

TLDR: ""We messed up, you didn't win this one but oh look you actually won a PREVIOUS contest which by the way the winners announcement was/is region locked to only Asia so that's why you wasn't/aren't able to see it, nor did we even contact you telling you that you won it, and even though the prize for that contest was the Xtreme Gaming edition we're going to give you a lesser prize G1 Gaming edition.""

nvidia,himmatsj,5,1,"Does anyone know at which temperature points do Pascal GPUs drop a boost bin?As everyone here should know, Pascal cards start out at a high boost, and then rapidly drop 12-13 MHz at a time before reaching a stable clockspeed. 

Assuming that the power limit is not being breached, it would mean that when the above happens, it is due to temperature-based throttling. 

In Maxwell 1.0 and 2.0, there were certain temperature points that were pre-programmed within the architecture that when hit, would cause the boost clocks to drop one bin. 

For the GTX 900 series for example, one boost bin was dropped at 65C, another at 75C, then at 78C and 80C. The default temp limit was usually 80C, but even if you dragged this out to 95C, the boost bins still drop at the pre-programmed points. 

As such, I would like to know, has anyone studied Pascal GPUs clockspeed behavior to see at which temperature points do they drop boost bins? It seems like there would be more temperature points (and maybe even earlier) when compared to Maxwell 2.0 for when the boost bins are dropped. "

While in Unigine Heaven, it reports 2164MHz, while PrecisionXOC reports 2126MHz. Then will eventually back-off, but never dips below 2100MHz.

As for temperatures, the card barely breaks 60C in benchmarks with my custom fan curve (http://imgur.com/a/ArVxd). Also, the noise levels are great. I only notice it when it ramps up a bit if the card hits 60C. With my headset on, I would never be able to hear it.

Tips &amp; feedback are welcome :)

Meaning that only certain versions of the new line-up are currently deliverable, the selection becomes especially sparse for the less popular/low-end coolers. 

Higher end models are available though, for an extremely inflated price however. The cheapest model is the GTX 1080 MSI Aero for €730,- which is far cheaper than the GTX 1080 MSI Gaming for 849,- for instance.

P.S. The cheapest non-blower style cooler costs 799,- (G1 Gaming by Gigabyte)

As information for these specific coolers is hard to find (Except for a handful of anecdotal claims), it would help out immensely if you could spare the time to post your Overclocking/Temperature results with said coolers!

Used Geforce experience to change brightness but at max it was still dark. Here are some photos I took: http://imgur.com/a/Rl6Ni

Now that I look at the photos, the camera makes it much brighter than it actually is. Also, some colors are not accurate at all. With the case LEDs off and my room lights off, it is as if there are not even LEDs on the bottom of the card. Submitted a ticket to EVGA but I would like some extra input.

I was initially worried since others here have pointed out that the FE can be pretty noisy compared to the AIB cards - it does get a bit loud, but it's nowhere near as bad as my old 7970 GHz under load, so I'm not bothered by it.

&amp;nbsp;

Haven't messed with overclocking yet (I honestly don't really need to at the moment as I still need to upgrade my 1080p/60Hz monitor). Card gets a little toasty with the windowed side panel (highest I've seen it get before setting a custom fan curve was 85°C - doesn't go over 75°C after setting a custom curve), but I like how it looks so I'll probably just take it off for intense stuff."

* NZXT H630 Case

I benchmarked it right after installing and it had horrific coil whine.  You can hear it [here](https://youtu.be/f8NbPDYbHmE?t=6) at 8 seconds in.  Even with the case closed it was still loud.

I have a spare Antec TPQ-1200 so I swapped it in.  You can hear the difference [here](https://youtu.be/oHykQNwZ86Y?t=11).  While you can still slightly hear the coil whine, the difference is significant.

I've tried googling this question in a few different ways, but all I can find are reviews, announcements about the cards, and people on forums asking about performance. I can't find anyone else with questions about the founder's edition end, if there is one.

I'm asking if or when I will be able to buy a 1070 for ~$380? Or did they hike the price after offering an unrealistic deal?"

From what I've managed to find, performance differences between these two cards will be very similar, with the 980Ti still pulling ahead. I have the opportunity to get a new 980Ti for around £410, which is also around the suspected launch price of a 1070. 


What benefits will I get out of a 1070? Other than more efficient in terms of power, is there any point waiting for AIB 1070s to be available, rather than just getting a 980Ti for ~£400 now?

As part of the driver upgrade i did a couple of test with the new driver and while talking with other overclockers it appeared there's an hidden directX12 upgrade in the last driver. 

I wrote 'hidden' because it's seems to show in some game but not others, so i don't know if it's a specific component of DX12 that's getting update, but there's definitely something going on!

For instance, in the benchmark ""Ashes of the Singularity"" on crazy preset at 1440p, i've worked on over 200BIOS to stabilize my 980-Ti at 1525Mhz core to achieve an average FPS of 46.4. Now with the new driver, some BIOS adjustement to stabilize the overclock again, i went to ... 49.1FPS, it's a nice boost of 6% on the same overclock.

I applied gc-extreme with a spatula, I wasn't worried about excess paste because the heatsink has a pressure mount, and the excess paste is forced out. 

I will be replacing the thermal pads soon as well.

nvidia,Baggotry,59,5,"Question about AIB cards...So, I don't follow GPUs too closely. I buy a new one every few years, and then ignore it until I need/want a new one.  I purchased this http://images10.newegg.com/ProductImage/14-127-675-08.jpg design a few years ago for my gtx 670, without doing any research into the acoustics, and the slight grinding noise the fan makes has annoyed me for years.

So with that in mind, I intend to get an AIB non-founder card when they are released.  Is it a fair assumption that each brand will use similar coolers they have used in the past in their cards? That is to say, they would LIKELY have similar acoustics/cooling performance?

If that's a correct assumption, which manufacturer should I keep an eye on for good performance, thermals, and acoustics from an air cooling solution?

Thank you."
nvidia,JayPeePee,20,8,"GeForce Experience OptimizationIs it just me or does anyone else feel like the GeForce optimization of games is a bit of a mess.

Or It says optimize max and suddenly I have resolution set at like 3840x2160 and not centered to the screen or scaled down. The on other games it works as intended. I am not running the greatest rig but with a 6700K processor, a 960, and 64GB of RAM it ain't no punk and I feel like it doesn't optimize.

nvidia,Rossky1751,17,1,"SLI compatibility and how it worksSo I've been doing troubleshooting for computer beginners for fun for quite some time now and my current knowledge about SLI configs is that you must pair 2 cards with the identical GPU and the exact same graphics memory to get it to work and if a card is paired with another one that has a different GPU, you can only get it to work with a lot of luck, the right drivers or have to use it to take the load that PhysX causes off one of the cards by letting the second one do that.

Now I came across someone that claims that 2 completely different cards (GTX 650 and GTX 960) can be combined without any problems but the 960 will reduce its clock speed to the one that the 650 dictates, which sounds strange.

I've been using an AMD card for quite some time now and haven't been looking into setting up SLI configuations so I want to know if my information is still up to date because these claims are surprising me to say the least."

nvidia,animeman59,28,6,"Update on my 364.71 driver issue. It is definitely the driver causing these problems.I suggest reading [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/4etl05/geforce_hot_fix_driver_version_36496/d23n306) first to get an idea of how I've been troubleshooting this issue, and trying to narrow down the problem with this driver.

So, right now, I have come to the conclusion that the problem of my monitors shutting off and not receiving a signal is the driver itself.

As you saw in update #2 in the post I linked, I thought that the PSU might have been the problem.  Electrical bugs always cause weird issues in computers, and I've seen plenty over the years when dealing with unresolved PC problems.

So I switched out my old Corsair AX760 to a newer EVGA SuperNOVA 750W power supply.  Connected everything up just fine, and I got no further issues.  I thought this was the end of the problems.  My PC is still on 361.91, btw.

But I still had a sneaking suspicion about the 364.71 driver.  So I updated from 361.91, and guess what happened?  The same problem popped right up on my machine.  Monitors suddenly lose connection whenever I fire up any 3D application with no way to bring the monitor back up without a hard reset.

So I quickly deleted the driver, and all software connected to it, and reloaded 361.91 again.  Problems gone.  I can fire up 3DMark, and run a full benchmark without issue, and I was able to play a full match on R6: Siege without the screen dying on me.

So it's definitely the driver that's fucking up my cards.  The PSU had nothing to do with it.  I even installed my old PSU into another older system I had, and also used my 980Ti in that system to see if I had further problems.  The PC ran just fine with no issues on driver 359.12.

Hope this somehow helps out other people here with similar problems.  Nvidia needs to fix this.  I'm hoping that any driver past 364 will be better."

nvidia,himmatsj,66,14,"2GB vs 1GB VRAM: How much of a difference can that extra 1GB really make, and for how long more will the 2GB hold up?Ok, so I currently have a 1GB GPU, a GTX 750. This post is NOT a complaint, but a genuine question to know if it makes sense to upgrade to a 2GB card or not.

I just finished playing Rise of the Tomb Raider. I had to use the LOWEST texture settings to get rid of stutters (on medium, it was a stuttery mess). But the textures looked absolutely horrible and painful on the eyes. 

Same case now with the Mirror's Edge Catalyst beta. In fact, even on the lowest texture settings there, I'm getting constant stutters possibly due to the fast-paced nature of the game and hitting the VRAM limit constantly. 

My question is simple, how much of a difference will it make to upgrade to a 2GB VRAM card? I'm talking solely from the angle of texture quality. In Rise of the Tomb Raider, would that suddenly enable me to play with High textures? The way I see it, I don't know how much an extra GB can bring to the table.

And second question, for how long more will 2GB VRAM be ""enough"" to play games at least at medium texture settings? I don't wanna be that idiot who buys a GTX 950 only to see myself relegated to playing on the lowest texture settings once again by the end of this year.

Edit: Also, can someone explain exactly, what does one extra GB of VRAM allow? I see in many games, 1GB is enough to play on Low textures, 2GB enough to play on High textures. How is this ""jump"" made? How come with just double the VRAM you can play with MUCH sharper textures? 

Edit 2: Is it also fair to say that due to the ""abundance"" of VRAM available on consoles (I hear up to 3GB in some cases), devs are becoming more liberal in their VRAM usage? In that, if they tried, they could get better texture/VRAM optimization, but there's just not much incentive to do it? "

It is known that if you play a game in Exclusive Fullscreen, this VRAM is ""written over"", so you effectively get the full amount for the game. For a 1GB card, you effectively get the full 1 GB to be used while playing the game. 

However, I was wondering, how does this work for Borderless Fullscreen games? Is that 200-250MB set aside since the desktop is being actively rendered at the same time? So effectively, somebody who has 1GB GPU will only have 750MB to use in-game when playing games that run in Borderless mode?

- waking pc often crashes pc (displays do not turn on until it reboots after the crash)
- desktop icons rearrange themselves randomly after successfully waking (as though the middle display disconnects and reconnects)
- sometimes when starting a game I can't get more than 20-25 fps until I restart my pc in which case it goes back to 144

&amp;amp;nbsp;

Additional notes: 

&amp;amp;nbsp;

- windows 10
- new monitor is asus rog swift 27"" with gsync 
- driver version is latest released (can update exact version later)

&amp;amp;nbsp;

All help is appreciated

nvidia,LightningGiant,3,0,"Debug mode questionHello,

&amp;nbsp;

I have a GIGABYTE GEFORCE GTX 780 WINDFORCE 3.0 and with 362.0 driver I'm having random freezes in some games(HOTS, Smite). Other driver version is crashing so 362.0 is the best I can get.

&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I tried debug mode from NVIDIA control panel and it looks like it fixed my issues(played 5-10 games and no freeze; before it was freezing at least every second game).

&amp;nbsp;

What debug mode actually does? I read that it should disable the overclock of the GPU but the game has same fps and it has 1110.5Mhz max registered clock while playing(which is more than default clock).

And for Maxwell support when Pascal arrives (780 and 780ti are performing very badly in recent games).
I can sell my 980ti now, stay with the R9 290 until the 1080 launch and then sell the 290 and buy the 1080 without spending much money.

I know the options are there in the control panel to set 10bpc however I have heard that the option is there regardless of whether the card supports it or not.

I have checked the specifications of the GPU however I couldn't see any mention of output bit depth.

The reason I ask is because I'm outputting to a Dell UP2715k, and I'm still getting greyscale colour banding in photographic applications even after they were set up correctly.

So my question is, do I get the i7-6700k with a 970 now and with the money I've saved from the 980ti; get new monitors, keyboard, mouse, speakers etc. or do I keep the monitors I have and spend money on the 980ti? Because it'll obviously be the better card.

The short answer is; Wait.

You should wait for Pascal, we are probably about a month and a half away from them being on store shelves. 

Realistically all we have right now are rumors that's true, but the kinds of rumors and leaks we are getting, and the rate at which they are happening, could mean that Nvidia is moving much faster with the launch of Pascal GPUs than before.

We do not have performance figures yet.

We do not have a set release date yet.

We do not know of the competing Polaris cards yet.

You should still wait if you can.

nvidia,Alarchy,6,3,"Driver crashing in certain games? Try replacing MSI Afterburner with EVGA PrecisionX, and removing overclocks.I have been having TDRs with the new driver, but only in one game (Diablo 3). It didn't happen very frequently (1-2 hours, or in intense multiplayer fights with lots of effects on screen), but it's been happening long enough that I finally got frustrated.  

The TDRs originally started happening after I installed MSI Afterburner (replaced EVGA PrecisionX) to test OC and monitoring with it, but I figured it was a coincidence since the TDRs kept happening after it was uninstalled. I thought that uninstalling Afterburner would reset my card to stock clocks, and didn't think to look at the clock speeds in game. Well, I finally checked with GPUz - my GPU was boosting to ~1482Mhz (default 1342) and memory was set to ~2000Mhz (default 1752), when it shouldn't be boosting at all in Diablo 3 in the first place. From my overclock testing, my card's memory isn't stable past ~1900Mhz so I figured that was a problem.     

So, the only thing I did was reinstall EVGA PrecisionX and set my old overclock profile - 110% power limit, 85c temp limit, no other OC. Card boosts to ~1450Mhz and memory is at ~1752Mhz, but the biggest thing - no TDRs in Diablo 3 for the entire night, when before they'd happen every 1-2 hours or in really intense fights.  

I have no idea how the clockspeeds from Afterburner were retained post-uninstallation, but somehow they were wrong at least according to GPUz. GPUz now reports the same clockspeeds as PrecisionX shows in game, so I think my clockspeed issue is solved. 

**TL;DR** I notice a lot of people use Afterburner, or talk about monitoring their temperatures with Afterburner, and I'm sure it's perfectly fine for the most part - but uninstalling it and replacing it with EVGA's PrecisionX (which ""repaired"" my card's clockspeed)  fixed the TDRs I was experiencing. It's possibly worth a shot."

Is there any way to turn this feature off?

The problem happens once my monitor becomes inactive, and goes into the power saving mode. Once that happens, I'm unable to wake it up anymore. The only option is hard reset. There is nothing in Event Logs - only warning saying that my computer was not shut down properly.

Aside from that, I sometimes get a message from Windows saying that the driver encountered error, and that Windows restarted the driver. I downgraded my driver to 361.91 and the problem disappeared.

nvidia,gholaday,4,1,"Problems with my 960m card. It keeps stuttering/freezing randomly in gameSo my computer used to be able to run most games fine, but recently it will freeze/stutter when I play games. For example when I play League of Legends my FPS will be 150+ and then every minute or so tank down to &lt;5, causing my computer to freeze and even audio from discord/game to stutter. So all games are pretty much unplayable now.

I initially thought it was a temperature issue but after downloading hwmonitor I saw that the gpu is always around 50C.

I tried doing a clean uninstall -&gt; reinstall of the drivers and am currently using version 361.75, but it didnt help.

I'm looking into the possibility of switching from my current GTX 980 SLI setup (more specifically: EVGA GTX 980 SC ACX 2.0 SLI/w i7 3770k - obviously selling the current cards I have) to a single GTX 980ti at 1440p with the same processor and was looking for any opinions/advice that you guys may have.

The price of doing this is not too much of an issue for me, but I have been experiencing some issues with the SLI set up on my current computer (micro stuttering in certain games etc..).  I've been looking around online regarding this and have found some conclusions that a single GTX 980ti is more stable and is better for a 1440p monitor (I have a ROG SWIFT) due to the extra VRAM.

I'm not exactly an expert on these kinds of things, so again, just wanted to know if any of you had any insights for me to see if going down this route would be worth it or not.

nvidia,warren_vanni,2,4,"ShadowPlay and Windows Defender Real-Time Protection CPU HogThis is a bit of a PSA for anyone that runs ShadowPlay and Windows Defender Real-Time Protection.
After turning on ShadowPlay to record my desktop I noticed that turning it resulted in Antimalware Service Executable using approximately 10% of my CPU all the time. Prior to turning on Desktop Recording the same thing was happening during gameplay. I record at a very high bit-rate so the effects are more noticeable for me than the average user, but I would assume that they are still there.
The best solution that I could find online was to disable the Real-time Protection option of Windows Defender. The better option, in my opinion, is to exclude the Nvidia Capture Server process from being scanned by Windows Defender. This allows for Windows Defender to remain running, but without permanently using some of the CPU.

Process:
Open Windows Defender (Start &gt; ""Windows Defender"")
On the ""Settings"" tab, select ""Excluded processes"" from the left column, and then ""Browse""
Browse to and select (or copy and paste under ""Process Names"") ""C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\ShadowPlay\nvspcaps64.exe;""

Ccleaner helps to fix it for a few minutes so I suspect the ccleaner delete a bad file or something that is causing that.
Also restarting the pc might work and fix it for a few hours or until I relog.

The fixes I tried so far:
-Upping the virtual memory from 3225 to 4500(idk if that was a good choice).
-Reinstalling my driver making sure its windows 10 supported.
-Making a new windows 10 account (local account).
-Deleting and scanning for possible treat.
-Deleting the windows.old folder which is the old windows 7 I had.
-Trying to optimize the game as good as possible which didn't help in all games.

Thus, the AIO GPU's really called out to me.

However, deciding which ones overclock performance takes the cake has been exceedingly difficult, as on the rare occasions AIO units are put up against each other, only one of them is overclocked in testing, so I can't see who's performance would trump whose in a OC'd environment.

My main picks now are the EVGA Hybrid (for dat OP Warranty and reliable performance), the Corsair Hydro GFX (for great performance overall), and the Gigabyte Waterforce (for what looks to be the greatest OC performance of them all, though held back by what I hear is terrible support).

Seems like im going to have to do a complete reinstall of windows 10 and reinstall all my games and other things.

But this was nothing more than a hastily made short-term policy decision from up high and the thing about it that really ruffles my feathers is their extremely bad customer communication--though I'm not exactly surprised, because this is pretty much the way it's always been.

I have an MSI 960 4G - and I'm trying to run 3 monitors. 


I've always been a dualie - and have run dualies since the dawn of time. These have been:



32"" Samsung via HDMI



19"" Acer via DVI (to VGA) - don't judge me.



But I've realised I could do with a third monitor, as it'd really help to display a few things permanently that I use in my home-office job etc. 



So, I dug out an old crappy monitor I've got - and got a DP to VGA adapter - and then put this into a DP port. 




It comes on - everything's fine. In fact, it can go for a couple of minutes being fine...but every now and then, it just flickers to black, and then back to life again. Sometimes it happens a lot (like 15 times in 10 seconds), or sometimes it can only be once a minute. 



Has anyone had a problem similar to this? Or know of any issues with what I'm trying to do? 




Things I've checked:



* It's not the monitor



* It's not the cable (but it *could be the VGA to DP adapter*) 





* Drivers are all up to date etc. 


* It's not resolution/refresh rate related



Any help appreciated!

Hello Reddit! I have a major concern...

I recently purchases a 980ti Hybrid from EVGA and I'm running into an issue. It appears that my card is not performing how I expected it to when I purchased it. I've done some research, and have seen people getting scores of around 17k-18k on a regular basis, with over 19k in Graphics score. I'm only getting 13k-14k, and my graphics score is 16,651.

Has anyone ran into the issue of an under-performing GPU like this before with the 980ti?
I've tried playing games on just 1080p, and I'm getting 50-60 frames, and this is in games like Battlefront and GTA 5 on high-ultra settings. The card in GPU-z and Precision is showing 99-100% usage, so I'm not sure what's going on...

nvidia,alanwu07,12,1,"SLI in Windows 10 Still a Problem?I've researched around for a couple of days but it seems like my SLI setup is still not liking Windows 10. I have an old setup so it's not really critical for me to use the second card for gaming and none of the games I play require me to have the extra 30-40% processing power. But I've looked around and it doesn't seem like there is a driver out yet that fixes it? I've tried going back to 355.80.

My setup:

- i7 2600k (It's OC'd at 4.2Ghz but it's very stable, so I doubt this is contributing to anything)

- 2x EVGA 560Ti (I have OC profiles but the flickering/flashing in Windows 10 happens on stock clocks)

- 8GB DDR3-1600

- Samsung 840 Evo + HD

Can obviously just keep running on one card, but I'd like to see if I can get both running so I can delay starting my new build to save up some more money. Any ideas?

nvidia,therealab,54,124,"It's been another 8 months, last thread was now archived. SLI+Gsync+DSR is STILL broken. The most loyal Nvidia fans are being thanked with learning their money was wasted.First of all, this isn't a help request thread. I know there's no fix. Maybe we'll find more workarounds in the next 6 months, and they need a place to be shared, so this can be it. Otherwise, this thread is simply to spread information from the perspective of the loyal customers who have been utterly ignored, **and to hopefully prevent anyone else considering building such a setup from making such an expensive mistake.**

Workarounds have been found, and subsequently patched out. The whole reason I went SLI was so that I could run DSR at crazy resolutions and get incredible image quality, and it worked until I got a g-sync monitor. Turns out it's a well-known fact that having SLI and g-sync will remove DSR from the nvidia control panel, forcing a choice between uselessly high framerates beyond 144fps, or having the image quality of DSR and additional video cards contributing as much performance as a brick in the computer case.

Furthermore, disabling gsync in the control panel doesn't actually disable the technology completely, as it doesn't bring DSR back to the control panel. The workaround was to enable 3d vision, which ACTUALLY disabled gsync, kill the 3d vision setup process, and enable SLI and DSR, yet now this isn't possible without actually having the 3D vision kit. The options are either let your fancy new gsync monitor collect dust and use an older monitor, or let your additional video cards collect dust.

Customers in this position have been blown off for years at this point, with no solution in sight. I've tried contacting all nvidia social media presences, with no result. May this thread be the discussion area for all loyal nvidia fans in this position for the next 6 months, with as much confidence in seeing a solution as seeing HL3 released in the same timeframe.

nvidia,cookiiej,12,0,"Nobody is giving me a Rise of the Tomb Raider code...Okay so, here's the deal: I bought a new GTX 980 5 days ago. It arrived on friday and I was happy to game on it. The webshop I bought it at advertised with a free copy of Rise of the Tomb Raider being included with the GPU. To my surprise, there wasn't any code. I contacted the webshop and they told me the manufacturer distributes codes. My card is made by Inno3D, so I went to their website. There I saw the redemption page. Turns out, their promotion only covers the South-east Asia territory. What the hell? They sell their cards worldwide, but the promotion only applies to a select area. That is absolutely absurt. I contacted Nvidia about this matter, and they told me they couldn't do anything about it. They had no codes to give.

So here I am, I bought the GTX 980 under the false premise I would receive a copy of Rise of the Tomb Raider. What now? Are there any reps around here who could help me? Should I return the card and buy a new one and hope that that one does come with a code? If I buy from a different brand it would cost me more, as much as a new copy of Tomb Raider, which would make it pointless. I hope somebody is able to help me because this just plain sucks :("

nvidia,REF5ESH,6,2,"Geforce GT 635M FPS Issues (League of Legends)I have had this laptop for 2-3 years and have recently been experiencing drops in FPS across multiple games for no obvious reasons. I had both the internal fans cleaned and the RAM upgraded (from 4 to 8) a couple of days ago, as I thought they were the main culprits behind the performance drops. There has been a slight improvement, but the drops are still quite noticeable.

The main game I play is League of Legends, and have been running it at 60 FPS on Medium settings without an issue until now. More intensive games like TERA and Blade and Soul used to run at a consistent 30 FPS on low settings, but now dip between 10-20.

I recently performed a full reset of Windows and prioritised performance over quality when using the NVIDIA Control Panel. At this point it looks like it may be a hardware issue, but I do not experience any issues outside of gaming, so to me it doesn't make much sense.

I was wondering if anyone could take a look at my specs and tell me if I should be experiencing FPS issues with a game like League of Legends. Suggestions are welcome, as I'm willing to tweak anything and everything to find a solution!

nvidia,Intel_CPU_AMD_GPU,19,0,"Why I went to Green GTX 970 and back to Red AMD R390From at least 5 website reviews using the AMD LATEST DRIVERS, the R9 390 BEATS the GTX 970 in terms of raw power. Shadow of Mordor (and probably more upcoming heavyweight titles) also uses more than 3.5GB of RAM and causes micro stuttering in Nvidia's controversial 3.5GB +0.5GB RAM, and that's where the power of AMD R390's 8GB RAM comes in.

1. http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Graphics-Cards/Sapphire-Nitro-Radeon-R9-390-8GB-Review   - for the Sapphire Nitro R9 390 8GB card, users will find that it is competitive with the performance of the GeForce GTX 970 4GB for a nearly identical price. It's not new, it's not flashy and it's not rewriting the world of GPUs, but it is at least slightly more than expected.

It operates very quietly and has performance that outpaces the competition. The Tri-X cooler keeps the GPU at a reasonable temperature and having 8GB of memory means you’ll have room for the high resolution textures sure to be found in future games.

Also google ""GTX 970 coil whine."" Plenty of pissed off owners of GTX 970 as well. A lot of owners are encountering coil whine issues (some seems badly mentally affected with the high pitched whines during benchmark loading, running etc ) with GTX 970 that are virtually close to none in AMD R390s. EVGA, MSI, ASUS, Gigabyte, Palit, Galaxy all have GTX 970 boards that may give you a potential coil whine nightmare especially for those who leave their side panels open and/or game without headsets. Some have did RMAs 4 times.

I bought a *** brand GTX 970 and got so pissed off with 2 exchanges of GTX 970 (Both still have coil whine, the last one is especially bad when paired up with a Corsair HXi-850 (Platinum). In the end, I went the AMD R390 route and never looked back. A quick test on 1600x900 unigine valley netted me 88 fps for the R390 over 78.9 fps for the GTX 970. That's a 9.1 fps advantage. A test on Uniheaven 1600x900 netted me 77.0 fps for the R390 over 72.8 fps for the GTX 970. That's a 4.2 fps, not too shabby. I'm running an Intel I7-6700K on an Asus Z170M-plus setup. Win 7 OS. 480 GB Sandisk Extreme Pro. Cooler Master V1000 (Gold). (Many corsair sucks, saw 2 units in RMA at the service centre, one is  RM series another is HX series). My Cooler Master Silent Pro 1000 lasted me 6 years and still going strong.

No coil whine nightmare on R390. For the GTX 970, its a lottery draw for you. 50-50 it seems. If you're lucky, u get a good batch. If you're not lucky, you get your life turned upside down by coil whine. Sapphire Nitro R390 runs silent and kool. I would take higher power consumption + raw brute power over the hellish coil whine anyday. Note that I change cards between green and red camps regularly.

I went green, but went red again.

nvidia,Neekthegeek,5,3,"Stuttering (micro) in every game starting about 2 weeks ago? (GTX 980)I bought a completely new computer last April, and games have run pretty much as expected. No problems at all really. I hadn't played a game in a couple of weeks and noticed a slight micro-stutter in CSGO almost as if it would just freeze for a millisecond every 2 seconds or so. I tried other games and the lag is still there. Dying Light, Portal 2, Tomb Raider and The Witness have all had the same exact problem. I did a clean install of my drivers (deleted all the old ones) and I noticed a huge improvement, but I still notice a slight amount of stutter but now instead of every 2 seconds it's probably every 20 seconds or so. But maybe I'm just crazy and noticing things that aren't really there. If I show the fps in-game (CSGO) you can just barely see it get cut in half for a millisecond (glows yellow) and then it goes back to normal. I also deleted the NVIDIA HD audio drivers because I read that can cause stuttering if you use Realtek HD audio alongside it. It's also worth mentioning that I hear a slight buzzing sound when I play games and when the game stutters the buzzing sound stutters with it. (sorry if I explained that poorly.) 

System info:

Most games are installed on second 500GB SSD but stuttering occurs no matter where the game is installed.
Windows 10 64bit

Couple of other things to mention:

* Card runs at around 65c - 70c when gaming

* Setting max pre rendered frames to 1 or 3 did help a bit, but I didn't have to do that before? Still slightly noticeable.

* No stuttering at all when watching a video file or a video online.

* Yes, I virus scanned with hitman pro and didn't find anything alarming.

* Checked if the power cables were loose, everything seemed fine.


Right now I'm backing up my PC and I'm going to reinstall windows and start from scratch to see if that helps but I'd like to maybe find an easier solution. Has anyone had a similar problem? Would appreciate any help I can get.

Edit: Installed today's new drivers. Opted out of the audio drivers and did another clean install. Restarted and joined a casual server in CSGO. Everything seemed pretty much perfect, which is strange. I started up Dying Light and that felt very smooth as well. Stuttering seems to be like 95% gone. Huge improvement from last night. It's hard to say if it's gone for sure as my gaming sessions today haven't been more than 5 minutes. I'll try more later. I set max pre rendered frames to 2 just to be sure.

edit 2: nevermind, stuttering is back. Reinstalling windows atm.

edit 3 **SOLVED**: Apparently the stuttering came back after 10 or so minutes no matter what I did. The stuttering was connected to the steam beta update (for the steam controller). I didn't see it hogging resources anywhere but anytime I was on the internet alongside the beta update I would just stutter to hell. Seems to be fixed now after opting out of the update."

When I played Metro 2033 for a few minutes, everything seemed fine afterwards.  Just by launching Sonic All Stars Racing Transformed, my idle temps get stuck at high.  Today, I tested Ziggurat.  Playing it for the first time and then exiting the game gave me no issues.  But the second time around my issue came back.  This problem only occurs after gaming, and it's kind of random at that. If I don't play anything and just browse the web, my idle graphs are normal.  The only way to get back my normal idle temperature is to restart the damn computer.  

I've googled for an answer for hours and I can only find users who share this issue that own a higher refresh rate monitor.  I've tried doing a clean install of the latest nvidia drivers, reinstalling afterburner, running virus and malware scans, and even reattaching and dusting my video card.  Nothing seemed to work, and I'm getting very frustrated.

Also what causes GPU throttling? Is it heat? Is 50-60 degrees Celsius enough to throttle my GPU or is it throttling because it's idle for more than 2-3 hours. How can you prevent throttling without restarting PC? Or is that not possible.

nvidia,Areos_Sargeras,25,2,"Help me choose a 980 Ti: ASUS Strix, Zotac AMP! Extreme, or Gigabyte Xtreme Gaming WindforceHoping a product suggestion doesn't fall under the umbrella of tech support, but here it goes.

I'm close to finishing my new system, and my next paycheck will allow me to bring home a powerful video card to top things off. As of now, I've been going back and forth between three different video cards; ASUS' Strix, the Zotac AMP! Extreme, and the Gigabyte Xtreme Gaming, all three of which I'm confident people here are already familiar with. My current thoughts on each card are as followed:

**ASUS Strix** ([~$670](http://www.amazon.com/GeForce-Overclocked-384-bit-DisplayPort-Graphics/dp/B011ERJTYU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451281767&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=gtx+980+ti+strix)): My current first choice of the three. It's a great looking card, is on equal footing with the Zotac AMP! Extreme in terms of raw power, and its red/black/silver coloration best matches the coloration of my build, which is a red/black/white coloration. However, reviews have shown it to run hotter and louder than most other non-reference 980 Ti cards, and people have noted that the pulsation of the Strix LED logo on the top of the card can only pulsate or be turned off via Nvidia Experience and cannot be changed to a solid glow, and I'm worried that such an effect would become very annoying over time. Have new drivers or firmware come along to fix this issue?

**Zotac AMP! Extreme** ([~$680](http://www.amazon.com/Zotac-PCI-Express-Video-Graphics-ZT-90505-10P/dp/B0100ZRFB6/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451281798&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=amp+extreme)): My second choice of the three. Although it's an equally awesome-looking card, I'm not sure it will fit the color scheme of the system. However, reviews state is runs quieter and cooler than the reference card and the Strix alike, and even uses less wattage than the latter choice, along with having a solid glowing LED that I prefer over a pulsating light.

**Gigabyte Xtreme Gaming Windforce** ([~$690](http://www.amazon.com/Gigabyte-GeForce-XTREME-Graphics-GV-N98TXTREME-6GD/dp/B017YPHVGO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1451281854&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=gigabyte+xtreme+gaming)): The third choice of the three that I decided to include mainly due to curiosity's sake. Although I have not found any benchmarks directly comparing this card to the others, isolated results have shown it to be one of the top competing 980 Ti cards. I haven't read how hot or loud this card may run, however. The best perk compared to the other two cards is the aesthetic LED customization, allowing not only the Windforce logo but the outer rim of the fan blades themselves to glow with a color of your choice. (In my case, red or white)

Does anybody have experience with these cards or their respective companies who can provide feedback in which is the best choice for me? Since all three cards should run relatively equally in terms of performance, I'm primarily looking over aesthetics, heat, noise, power consumption, and company etiquette. Card size isn't an issue (Phanteks Enthoo Luxe), and my budget lies between $600-$700.

I'm also willing to listen to other options people may offer. I've heard nothing but good things about EVGA's customer support, for example.

And just in case it's relevant, system specifications are:

- Gigabyte GA-Z170X Gaming 7
- Intel Core i7 6700k @ 4.0GHz (Current OC @ 4.5GHz)
- Corsair h100i GTX Liquid Cooler
- Corsair RM850X PSU
- Corsair Dominator Platinum 16GB(8x2) @ 3GHz
- Samsung EVO 850 250GB SSD
- PNY GTX 770 4GB Superclocked (My current, sad video card)"

G1 is $200 cheaper where I live, and it's waterblock covers all of it's components, but power phase is not as strong as the EVGA and GB support is nowhere near as good as EVGA's.

And it works exactly as expected in other games (For example Fallout 4, or Rocket League).

However, for all of this being the same... Isaac acts differently. When I hit my 'save' button, the video is saved as expected. The screen flickers for just a moment, and the video is immediately available. I can also alt-tab out and hit save and it works the same way.

However, when she hits the save button nothing happens. It's like the key combination doesn't do anything. And if she alt-tabs out of the game and then hits save, the video saves... but the full five minutes is that pause menu. And to top it off, the sound is right you hear the gameplay behind it, but only see that pause menu!


Anyone have any idea on this?"

nvidia,ismebrandon,15,0,"Upgraded from R9 290 to 980 Ti... lower fps than usual for CSGO?Hey guys, here is my specs for reference:

8Gb RAM
Z87x-UD3H

Recently upgraded from an R9 290 Sapphire Trixx to the 980 Ti...
I usually get a stable 250-300fps with my R9 290 but recently when I installed my 980 ti I get a really bad fps drop/fluctiaton from 120-250 fps, sometimes it can micro stutter as well. 
I've change the Control Panel stuff but that doesnt seem to help, from what I've read, many other 970/980/980ti users also have this problem... that their GPU is running fine for every other game except CSGO. I believe it may be a driver issue? Also when looking at my GPU utilization it only goes up to 25-30% but I have high performance power option enabled and in the control panel as well.

What would be the latest/best driver to revert back to for optimal performance in CSGO?

I'm a pretty csgo addict so bear with me here haha

nvidia,silents429,6,2,"Nvidia questionsNext Tuesday is payday and I buy my first GPU

I have been having a long battle on whether to get the R7 370 or the GTX 950 (104$ vs 108$)

For awhile I was content grabbing the R7 and forgetting about it due to my older brother having more experience with AMD, and me having an AMD processor.

I now decide to screw that, because the 950 is more powerful and isn't molesting my power supply, nor is it a damn refresh of another refresh.


Anyway I have some Nvidia questions that I'd like cleared up.

1. How long does Nvidia support a GPU? I keep hearing stuff about Nvidia dropping support for newish cards and not supplying them with any new features or things along those lines, I will pick AMD in this case because they support things for a long while with driver updates and features.

2. Is EVGA SC+ ACX2.0 950 a good version of the GPU, is there anywhere with a specific review for this model I could read?

3. How are the drivers and software, I hear it back and forth on the driver situation and understandable if I hang around here in a problem area I am going to hear about problems, but overall is the driver experience (think before Windows10) pleasant? Is the software Nvidia uses decent?

4. Is there anything I should know, maybe a warning you'd give to first time buyers or anything you just don't enjoy about Nvidia? I really want my expectations in check.


In regards to AMD the R7 is the best I can get with this budget, and the next step up with AMD is not only a tiny gap but requires connectors and more power that my 450PSU doesn't have."

[B]Nothing was changed in these setups besides the processor.[/B]

We've been playing games like Dead Rising 3, Arkham Knight, Crysis 3, Metro Last Light, and GTAV. Until few days ago, we learned that our GPU usage was not going above 60%-70%.

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/143598/cpuuse_1440.png

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/143598/Fallout4_2015_11_26_02_42_00_077.jpg

We did some testing by putting our parts into a 3rd persons rig who was running a MSI 980ti (http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814127902) and a 4790k. Everything else in the rig was kept constant. Games tested like AK, Fallout 4 and GTAV where we saw 90%-99% GPU usage. Sorry for phone picture.

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/143598/IMG_1720.jpg

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/143598/IMG951716.jpg

So we concluded that our setup was being bottlenecked by our 4670k. My buddy ordered a 4790k and kept his 980ti and got this test screenshot:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/143598/AK_4790.jpg

However, the problem wasn't fixed. We still noticed some drops in GPU usage when we tested Fallout 4. 

We kept the exact savefile, exact graphics settings, nothing was changed here except we tested on a 980ti then on a 970. CPU was the new 4790k.

980ti: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/143598/FO4_980ti.jpg

970: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/143598/FO4_970.jpg


So now my question is, is this just an isolated event where there is a fault with his 980ti or is his a common occurrence with all 980ti Hybrids? Because he RMA'd his and I will be getting my 4790k Tuesday and I'm wondering if I'll run into the low GPU usage too. If I do run into lower GPU usage, what are the chances that TWO cards are faulty? Could it be the Hybrid line of cards?"

Current setup:

- Corsair RM750 power supply

- GeForce 960 (Zotac)

- AsRock Z97 Extreme6 motherboard

- i7 4790S cpu

- 16GB RAM


Two reasons I want to upgrade.

1) I'm getting a [Dell 34"" curved widescreen monitor](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824260239). Gotta push the pixels. 3440x1440.

2) I want to prep for VR (Oculus, etc).  Min reqs they give so far are GeForce 970/R9 280.

Here are the important factors to me:

1) Stability. My son plays on this too, and if I'm out of town, I can't afford to have it crashing left and right. This is where AMD concerns me (from the research I've done). I haven't had any issues with the GeForce 960 so far.

2) Worthwhile upgrade from the 960.

3) ""Good enough"" FPS on games. Borderlands 2, Kerbal, Minecraft (yeah, I know they're all good enough for those).

4) It'll work on the rest of the current hardware.

5) It'll last a while.

The 980s I've looked at in the ~$430 price range are right on the edge of tolerable. Less is better, obviously, but $100 is worth it now if it buys me 6-9 months down the line.

I bought the ASUS GTX 970 Turbo card ([link here](https://www.asus.com/us/Graphics-Cards/TURBOGTX970OC4GD5/)) and expected to be able to crank out max setting in Fallout 4 (sorry about the Fallout 4 hypetrain, but choo-choo). Indeed the ""GeForce Experience Game Optimization"" thinks that I should be able to max the settings, and when I started up Fallout 4 after installing the new graphics card the recomended setting were also set to Ultra. However when I play at these setting I'm getting huge FPS problems. I'm a quite dissapointed now and I hope there is something wrong in front of the computer (me) rather than within it (with my GPU). Do you have any idea what can have gone wrong? I've tried lowering the graphics settings significantly and see some improvement, but I bought this card to be able to play on higher graphics levels and I don't want to play at low-medium and still get lagg.

I've done a full system reset after installing the card and reinstalled all the drivers etc. Really would appriciate all the help I can get.

The game runs fine at 40+fps. But after mostly 2-3 minutes of gameplay, Fallout 4 crashes to desktop with the folowing message popping up:

The event viewer has the folowing to say about it:

While I was in the vault the game did not crash as often. Maybe every 10 minutes, it only crashed 1 or 2 times, so I'm not sure.

When I talk to the robot when I return home the game crashes every time, before I can finnish the dialogue, much sooner than if I go somewhere else, this has happened multiple times both in windows 8.1 and 10.

When I restart the game directly after it crashes it crashes immediately during the intro. If I wait a couple of minutes it lasts 2-3 minutes.

I've been trying to find a sollution to this problem for the since the game came out, and I'm coming to you for help.

- I've tried downclocking the gpu as mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/3s9nc2/nvidia_windows_kernel_mode_driver_has_stopped/cwvd73n)

But let's switch topics.

I recently acquired the long-awaited Shield tablet from nvidia. Loving every minute of it was waiting for a while. It does many things. Streaming natively to twitch is one of them. I also have shadowplay on my PC and I know it streams natively to twitch. It also streams TO the shield. But here are the questions.

Firstly I don't care for twitch very much, I'd rather stream (or if I can't, just record to PC) to youtube.

Secondly I'd like to stream a game from the tablet to PC, not the other way around.

I'd also like to add a camfeed in there. No I don't scream into my games like Pewds, in fact I've never actually done this. I'd like to try since this thing is so capable, to somehow mash it all into one.

Not sure how.

So i figure the best course of action is to stick with Nvidia as a whole. Just to make sure: I can pair cards of different gens now right? Maybe pairing a future card of Pascal or Volta with the one I'm using now will let it handle the async compute problem. Just for future-proof sake, is it a viable option, or must I get an AMD card?

nvidia,Cyanesoon,5,0,"About to uninstall and reinstall all nvidia drivers(questions and concerns)Hey, everyone. I, personally am not about to do this because my computer runs just fine, my buddy however has been having huge computer issues and I'm kind of the go to tech-support guy in our group.. Even though I'm not especially trained or experienced in it.. I'm just better at google than the average person.

My friend who is having these issues is also very lazy and thinks this fix will take a lot of time when in reality it will probably take 15-30 minutes depending on his DL speed. Which I hear is very bad as of late.

So anyway, after finding out exactly what computer he has, and teaching him about Event Viewer on Windows 8.1, we found out that the critical error causing his computer to randomly crash while gaming was 'Kernel Power 41.'

The most common cause I've found of this is either a problem with GPU drivers or faulty USB equipment, in this case, it can be both because he threw his computer at a wall in a fit of rage, apparently.. So the most common solution is uninstalling all GPU drivers, restarting, and then reinstalling drivers manually.

My concern is, I can only find the NVIDIA game ready driver download on their website, so I'm wondering about all the other drivers such as the ones I have here in this screenshot:
[Link](http://puu.sh/l2KsM/7adaa6a8e2.png)

So I guess my question is, when I have him uninstall drivers, should I have him uninstall everything, including audio and 3D vision, etc. 

Will the single driver DL from NVIDIA's site redownload all that, unincluding GeForce Experience obviously?

Sorry for the wall of text, I hope I covered everything.

Recently I had got my second 970 replaced (had a fan fault) and after I'd installed it, Nvidia control panel wasn't picking it up. I didn't look too much into it as one of the first things I'd done was update my nvidia drivers to 358.50 and that did the trick. Not long after I started getting BSODs although it doesn't seem like it's related to the gpu but rather my cpu - disabling my 0.8ghz overclock stopped the BSODs (overclocked to 4.2ghz constant for probably over a year now - probably wear and tear).

Unfortunately I didn't realise this before removing my second GPU and running the Plan9 visualiser (turned out to be a reliable way to trigger the BSODs) - basically what I had tone was run teh test with both GPUS (crash) and then remove the second gpu that had been replaced and tested it again (crash). THEN I decided to disable the overclock and hey presto, no more BSOD!

But now I have another problem - when I put the second gpu back in it had the same problem as before where nvidia control panel won't recognise the SLI setup (option to enable SLI not present - instead just has ""Configure surround, phys X"" tab instead). Easy right? Just update drivers again, worked last time. Well, I was already at most recent so I uninstalled drivers using Display Driver Uninstaller and then re-installed 358.50. Nope. Ooookay, so I rolled back to the previous version 355.98. Still nope. Updated to 358.50 from there, still no dice. I've yet to roll back further but not sure if it's worth the time wasted on trial and error (please let me know if it is although it's crazy to think that could solve the problem).

So entered boot menu on BIOS - system browser recognises both 970s just fine.Had a look on device manager and aha! Little yellow icon denoting troubles afoot on the second 970. ""Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"" Googled this and from what I can tell the best answer is ""something is wrong.""

So I've swapped the 970s around and it's whichever 970 is in PCI bus 2 that has error code 43. To double check this I also had just one 970 at a time in bus 1 and both worked fine (I've not done the same with just bus2 as I'm not sure if that would work).

I've yet to try a different SLI bridge but I don't think that's the problem (but will get another one if people recommend I do so - seems to be more about what is causing the error 43 code though). I'm a bit worried a short circuit that happened about a year ago may have turned my mobo (or at least that region) a ticking time bomb - I had a network card that didn't quite fit the case so it wasn't screwed in super securely - it became loose without me realising which caused a short - the contacts on the network card showed burns. Admittedly I forget which port it went into but I think it may have been the PCIe 2 port which my second 970 is in. I might be worrying about nothing though.

Any suggestions would be hugely appreciated - I'm not the most tech savvy and I'm more or less out of ideas. It's been one problem after the next with this PC and it's somewhat exhausting!

Also as a side if anybody would be willing to peruse my BSOD reports please let me know. As I said, it seems to be related to CPU overclock but perhaps there's a more specific problem that I'm unaware of (and perhaps even related to this gpu problem). Again, much appreciation for anyone who is up for taking a look at that :)"

Since I'm mostly playing multiplayer, competitive games like CS:GO, League of Legends and so on, I need to choose graphics card because those games starting to be unplayable on laptop. Of course, I would like to play games like GTA V, upcoming serials like Hitman, Mirrors Edge, Fallout 4 (you get the point), but mostly going to focus to CS:GO where I need to maintain 250+ FPS on low/medium details on 1024x768 resolution, eventually 1280x1024.

nvidia,Dempf,6,3,"Monitor connected to the integrated graphics card stops working when I install Nvidia drivers in W10So I have 4 monitors connected to my 2x 980ti in SLI. I want to add a 5th monitor to my setup, but the 980ti only supports 4, so I decided to run the 5th monitor on integrated graphics. Many mobos will disable integrated graphics when a discrete card is plugged in, but mine supports running them both at once (MSI Z97A Gaming 7). I can get this working just fine (with a few quirks) in W8.1 but no dice in W10.

When I boot the computer with no drivers, I get the following output from my monitors:



 | 980ti | 980ti | 980ti | 980ti | Intel
---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
**Output?** | Y | N | N | N | N


If I proceed to install the Intel display drivers then I get this output:

 | 980ti | 980ti | 980ti | 980ti | Intel
---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
**Output?** | Y | N | N | N | Y

And finally if I install the Nvidia drivers then I get this output:

 | 980ti | 980ti | 980ti | 980ti | Intel
---|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----
**Output?** | Y | Y | Y | Y | N

Curiously enough, output shows up from the integrated display if I'm in ""duplicate"" mode in Windows. But I don't need 5 monitors showing the same thing dangit! It's only in extend mode where the one plugged into the integrated card stops working.

So anyway I'm trying to figure out whether it'll be more productive to complain to NVidia, Intel, Microsoft or MSI since it seems like there's some compatibility issue going on here and honestly I'm not sure whose fault it is. Does anyone have any suggestions of things I could try in the meantime? I'm strongly considering throwing my hands up in the air and reverting back to Windows 8.1...

My specs:

Note: I also [posted this](https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3mjwwj/monitor_connected_to_the_integrated_graphics_card/) over in /r/techsupport for visibility.

Edit: OK I'm not sure why I hadn't tried this yet (MSI tech support suggested doing it when I called them), but I installed a Geforce 780 I have lying around (with only 2 monitors attached to it due to output limitations) and I'm able to use the integrated card just fine. It seems like the problem is only with the 980ti.

Edit2: HOLY SHIT I GOT IT TO WORK. [Pic1](http://i.imgur.com/kdBddLs.png) [Pic2](http://i.imgur.com/pxv3puC.png)

During my testing this time I noticed that any time &lt;4 monitors were plugged into the 980ti it would cause the HDMI output from the mobo to start working. But when I plugged in the 4th monitor it would go to a config that I had setup awhile ago with all 4 monitors arranged based on their physical configuration. I kind of suspect that the Windows display manager (Windows Display Settings) is getting confused and seeing 4 monitors in a config that it's seen before, so it tries to recreate that config (which is usually a very nice feature). The problem here is that the config I had setup didn't include the mobo output. At least that's the most rational explanation I can think of at 4am.

Anyway I fixed it by plugging the HDMI from the mobo into a different Dell monitor. Then I plugged the Displayport from the different Dell monitor into the one I swapped from. Essentially I swapped cables on 2 of the monitors, one of which had output coming from the mobo. After that I was able to get output on all 5 monitors.

Since my ultimate goal is to have SLI enabled and Surround enabled on 3 of the Dell monitors plugged into the 980ti, I went and enabled SLI and Nvidia Surround. That unfortunately caused the mobo output to get disabled. BUT I was able to get output from the mobo again by switching to duplicate and then back to extend.

TLDR: If you have an issue like this try swapping cables around and enable/disable extend and duplicate screens."

nvidia,natshuba,17,11,"New EVGA 980TI dual monitor (144 and 60HZ) CRAZY FPS DROPS when watching stream/video on 60hz monitorHi Guys, i've been posting EVERYWHERE and am desperate for a fix.

Long story short, I recently 'upgraded' my PC and bought a new i7 4790K @4.00GHZ, new mobo (Maximus 7 Hero Asus ROG), 850W Power, EVGA 980 GTX TI, 32GB of RAM Corsair Vengeance I think.

I had someone help build it up for me.

So the problem is everytime I'm watching a video or stream(twitch) on my secondary monitor (the 60HZ one) my main monitor would get massive FPS drops when playing games. Even CS:GO (It would go from 300 FPS stable to around 25-40 literally unplayable). This happens to all games (H1Z1, Dota2, League of Legends, Rainbow Six Siege, etc).

My settings are not set to 'ultra' even in CS:GO most of them are set to low with exception of shader settings.

I've turned vsync off in the nvidia control panel and set my main monitor to 144 HZ and 2nd monitor on 60Hz. And the rest is default settings minus vsync off as mentioned above.

The main monitor (benq 2730T) is connected through DVI and the second monitor is connected through HDMI both to the GPU.

Now I've even called EVGA and NVIDIA seperately and firstly they mentioned that the problem might've been that the two monitors are on different refresh rate, however prior to 'upgrading' I had a EVGA GTX 670 and I didn't have any problem watching a stream and playing CS:GO (which is the most baffling to me as it is a FAR inferior card).

Secondly they told me that maybe if I hook up the 2nd monitor to my MOBO it would fix the issue, it didn't, infact it made it worse (I'd get even worse FPS drops)

Any idea on how to fix this? My friend said maybe my card is faulty, however when I'm not watching anything on my 2nd monitor, I can run any game pretty much on ultra and have a good 100-300 FPS even Ark. Pretty desperate as currently I was 'better' off with my 'old' setup than my upgraded PC as I love to watch streams and play games.

I've also tried this with multiple browsers and it's still happening, including turning off hardware acceleration in flash player and in chrome.

TLDR: Bought a 980 GTX TI and a 'super' computer, can't watch stream/video while playing games on a dual monitor setup, causing the game to drop from 300 FPS to 25-40 FPS.

Edit: Fixed it apparently one of my RAM wasn't plugged in correctly or something (I have 32 GB so all the slots are taken but idk, I played around with the ram and it works now). People with problems below if you have 16GB ram (only 1 set), try to make sure they're in the same color its a common problem!"

I've been playing Ark for the past two weeks, along with using Polar Capture, and 3ds Max for work with no problems at all. Until yesterday when Ark started crashing. My screen would lose connection and would go black and I could not access task manager. I would have to do a hard reboot. 

Then it started happening when browsing the web trying to find fixes. I've found a few, but they were several months/years old. 

What do I need to do to fix this? Thank you!

nvidia,HviteKristsDod,26,8,"Windows 10 - Freezing/black screen after resuming idle monitors?Wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar to this. Will try to explain it as best as I can, then link specs.

Please note that this **only** occurs on 355.82 and 355.98. 355.60 doesn't cause this.

My computer is set to ""Turn off all displays"" after 10 minutes, and it spins down idle HDDs after 20 mins, but it is set to NOT sleep the computer itself. Basically, I have it set to just remain in this idle state with displays and secondary drives turned off, while the PC itself is still powered ON. **With 355.60**, if I leave the computer idle for more than a few hours (overnight for example) and return, moving the mouse/hitting a key on the keyboard wakes both displays immediately and no issues occur. **With 355.82+**, waking the monitors after a few hours of idle results in one of a few things occurring: either **1)** the monitors turn back on, but to a black screen, and then the entire computer hard freezes and needs to be rebooted via the physical case switch (Ctrl+Alt+Del does nothing), or **2)** the monitors turn on, screens remain black for 10-15 seconds, then the displays resume. Once this happens, if I check Event Viewer I see tons of ""nvlddmkm"" event ID 14 errors during those 10-15 seconds. Occasionally, the computer will also BSOD immediately after the monitors resume with a SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION. None of this seems to occur on 355.60, where the monitors resume from idle after many hours almost instantly and never lock up afterwards that I can recall. I've rolled back to 355.60 for now, but as you can imagine, this is a pretty severe problem and prevents me from safely using the 355.82 driver revision for MGSV: The Phantom Pain, for which those are the game-ready drivers. I used DDU before installing both 355.82 and 355.98, unfortunately no luck with either.

Specs:

GPU: EVGA GTX 980 Ti Superclocked (reference, stock overclock only)

CPU: i5-4670K (stock clocked)

MoBo: ASUS Z87-A (latest BIOS, 2103)

RAM: GSkill F3-2400C10D-16GTX

Drives: Intel 730 480GB, Seagate 4TB 5900RPM

PSU: EVGA SuperNova G2 850W

Monitors: Acer XB270HU, Dell U2715H (both connected via DisplayPort)

OS: Windows 10 Pro x64

Edit: Just thought I'd add that I've already RMA'd the PSU and GPU before I realized the problem was only occurring with certain drivers, neither RMA helped."

With Diablo 3 it freezes when I start a game.

So I looked up some things and it says to try 350.12 and it's still giving me issues.
Other things I've tried, fresh install with DDU in safemode. Malwarebytes scan in safemode. Registry cleaner with CCleaner.

Card is stock of course, I just installed it. No OC or anything, also installed MSI Afterburner to see if it was messed with but the numbers are the same."

nvidia,MercenaryOne,13,0,"750Ti OverheatingI bought an Asus 750TI a little under a year ago(upgraded from 260 GTX OC). I recently installed Win10, and games crashed on a constant basis, I upgraded my drivers from nVidia for Win10 x64, and disabled them from being updated in Windows. And games still constantly crashed. I installed speedfan to see that my GPU was getting extremely high temps 80+ celcius.

So i reverted back to Windows 7, and I have now received 2 BSOD's of MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION while playing Dota 2. The game even crashes to desktop constantly and it seems to be when the GFX card reaches above 60 celcius. I never had this issue before I upgraded even though I am back on Win7.

Is it possible windows 10 damaged my gfx card from causing it to overheat? And is there any possible way that if it did that I am covered under warranty?

First, I want to say I am happy to be a part of the community here.  As a recent convert from AMD, my 980Ti has provided me the smoothest gaming experience I have had to date.

I just wanted to say that I feel this subreddit, at least in comparison to /r/Amd , is very heavily ridden with tech support questions. We even have in the sidebar that this is not a place for tech support. From an outsider, this subreddit paints a very bleak picture of the nvidia user experience. I may only speak for myself, but as a Windows 10 user, I have not experienced any of the crashes or issues that it seems almost everyone here experiences.

Perhaps there is a way we could mediate the content, i.e. filters - so that news, and content posts not necessarily centered around issues will poke through.  However, this is just my opinion. Sorry for those who are experiencing such driver problems and graphics crashes.

I know $45 is meaningless in the long term, but I am on a budget, so I'd like to know whether the stronger 970 (w/ backplate and higher core clock) is worth the extra $60.

Thanks.

I'm considering upgrading my EVGA 670 SC to a new EVGA 970 SCC.

The card I'm looking at is around $320 USD ($430 CAD). With Canadian sales tax it is around $375 USD ($500 CAD).

I plan on selling my GTX 670 for around $105 USD ($140 CAD), which will make the net purchase cost around $270 USD ($360 CAD). 

I play on a 1080p, 120hz screen. I usually don't buy GPUs when they release, as I like to wait for cheaper prices - But I will make an exception if it comes to the great performance upgrade Pascal is rumored to bring.

Wait for Pascal? Or go for this 970 (to last me about a year?). I'm in no rush to switch out my 670, but when it comes to games such as Far Cry 4, it is DEFINITELY starting to show its age.

So this problem has been going on for a while, across multiple driver revisions.  I didn't really take stock of it until recently because I had switched to playing a lot of games in borderless fullscreen mode.  

What happens is, when I switch a game to full screen mode, I drop about 20% of my FPS, and my GPU utilization never usually goes above 80%.  Switching back and forth between modes in games has no effect, it will just lop off the frames in fullscreen, and run like a dream in borderless or normal windowed.  I have noticed this problem in Witcher 3, Killing Floor 2, and Elite:Dangerous.  When I use my Oculus DK2 to play games this doesn't seem to happen.  

A few weeks ago I did a complete uninstall of Nvidia drivers with DDU and safe-mode, but I recall having this problem before I did this with multiple drivers, and am still having it now obviously.  I did some googling before I posted here, and searched this sub, and didn't find anything quite like it, and what I did find that was similar had no solutions, or solutions I have already tried.  I'm kind of at a loss here.  If anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them.  Thanks.

I'm pretty new to both modding and overclocking, and I'm learning a lot about modding, but know nothing about overclocking, except that doing it wrong will get you a crispy fried graphics card.

I'm trying EVGA precision with a modded Skyrim at the moment, and increasing random things in small increments, but my framerate is pretty much stuck at ~25-30, depending on where I am. Although respectable, 60fps would be nice. I'm running the official high-res texture pack, but not the unofficial one, along with a few small ones (ie. improved blood, ivy, etc) and a lighting mod (NOT an ENB).

One thing I noticed with the OSD is that my GPU% is currently maxed out. I mean, that's probably the issue, but this card was expensive and I was kinda hoping I'd be able to run the Skyrim 2K textures. Is there anything I can do to optimize my setup/improve it? Any tips on overclocking? "

nvidia,G1D3ON,16,7,"BF4 - Low GPU UsageHi guys,
Just wanted to get some advice on issues I am facing on Battlefield 4. I bought a new rig recently (i7-4790k, GTX 980 Ti) and for BF4, on maps such as Paracel Storm and Hai Resort, I noticed that my GPU usage usually hovers at around 50 to 70%, with my framerate dipping to the 60s. I have settings mostly on Ultra (MSAA turned off). Performance feels a bit sluggish and I get the feeling that I should be getting higher frames with my setup.
I am gaming at 2540x1440 on a 144Hz ASUS ROG Swift monitor. I tried lowering the resolution to 1080p and with the same graphic settings, my GPU usage dropped further (to about 40%) and with the framerate still hovering around the same level. I have set Nvidia Control panel settings to ""Prefer maximum performance"" but the problem persists.
One more thing I notice is when I use the console command “perfoverlay_drawgraph 1”, the yellow line (representing CPU) seems to be consistently higher than the green line (GPU) – this seems to mean my i7-4790k is bottlenecking my GPU? Does that make sense? You can also see the spikes in my video.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A-0DryKMOs

With my rig setup, I was expecting better performance actually - the thing is this issue seems to crop up for BF4 only. For other games like The Witcher 3, I have no issues getting 99% GPU usage with good framerates.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!
*Edit: one more thing to mention is that I have the 980Ti at a modest overclock of 86MHz using MSI Afterburner. I tried reverting to stock clocks and uninstalling MSI Afterburner but it didn’t seem to help.
The thing is, if i increase resolution scale to 150%, the gpu usage will go up to 99% and there isn't any cpu bottlenecks etc. My frames will be around 60 to 70. My question is why can't it scale backwards where I play at the default 100% resolution scale and get higher frames. So is it an issue with the card or the game?

*Edit: Just made a video of The Witcher 3 to show the gpu usage in that game..

1. Downloaded an older version of nvidia drivers. I choose the 331.65 which is for windows 8, and is dated 10/23/2013 !!
2. I disabled  automatic driver updates. System Properties -&gt; Device Installation Settings -&gt; Never install driver software from windows update.
3. Downloaded DDU http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html
4. Restart in safe mode and clean the nvidia drivers using DDU.

I'm posting on behalf of a friend (he can't post since he created his reddit account 2 minutes ago).

He encountered an issue when enabling Nvidia Surround on his PC. He has 3 monitors, 2 PC ones (24"" 1920x1080 / 23.6"" 1650x1050) and a ""TV"" one (24"" 1920x1080).

His problem is the following : when he ticks all 3 screens, the Surround resolution displays 3072x728.

How can he increase the resolution (to something like 5520x1050)?

nvidia,NickSoftlight,7,4,"Upgraded from GTX 670 to GTX 980 - In need of some advice.So I've recently switched to GTX 980 from my GTX 670 (both are ASUS subvendors). And the first thing I've noticed is that GOD the coolers on a 980 are freaking loud, almost terrifyingly so. So the first thing I checked was my GPU temps and loads (was using GPU-Z but then switched to MSI Afterburner and after that tried ASUS GPU-Tweak which became my favorite). So the problem with my 980 is that it's almost always capped at 80c while playing games like Witcher 3 or GTA V. Now, I know some people say that 80c is really acceptable, but here's the thing: while playing GTA V with the same setting on a 670 I was getting maybe 75c at the most. With those setting on a 980 I'm getting a 80c load (and it is capped by the Power Target - who knows maybe it can go even higher). I would be fine with that if not for the horrific noise that GPU coolers produce. Is this something that this GPU does? I am not using many coolers on my PC case, In fact I'm only using one, but that wasn't an issue with the 670.I was getting 78-85c temps at the most while playing very demanding games. CPU temps were (and still are) fine too, 75c~ (30-35c when idle). Right now I have my doubts that if I upgrade and add more coolers to my PC box it will solve this issue. Also, while being at 80c my GPU is only half-loaded like maybe 60% load at the most.
I've set GPU Power Target to 80% in GPU Tweak and Gpu Temp Target to 68 max. That solved the issue because my GPU simply won't go higher than that, but I don't really want to do it because I'd like to use 100% of my GPU potential. So what is your advice? What should I do? 

EDIT: Issue solved, turns out I didn't properly connect the wires from the PSU to GPU which was causing it to overheat. Now it's 68~c under heavy load.

nvidia,ShamisOMally,4,8,"Fixing 120/144hz monitor stuck at 60hz if desktop expanded/cloned to another monitor/capture device that is 60hzOk, in the past this was very easy to do, with windows 7 or windows 8.1 setting two different refresh rates was very easy.

Why do you do this? Well because you game on your monitor, and have your output to a device like an Elgato HD60 for game capture. Or you have an expanded desktop to a 60hz monitor.

Anyways, with windows 10 no matter what it was locking my gaming monitor to 60hz no matter what. Finally found the solution, this series of steps should work for you, I've done it three times with success.

-1. After installing your drivers, go into Nvidia control panel and go to Change Resolution. Make sure every monitor is set to their highest color output, in my case, HDMI output to the elgato HD60 is 12bpc.

Do NOT set your refresh rate here! If you do it will error up and when you clone, it will lock the gaming monitor to 60hz after you clone it.

Then go to Adjust Video Color Settings, under every monitor you have hooked up set ""With the nvidia settings"" and under the advanced tab set Dynamic Range to Full.

Close Nvidia panel. Reboot.

-2. Download Custom Resolution Utility here. http://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU

Run CRU.exe

Under EVERY monitor, delete every profile listed under detailed/standard res. After all are deleted, click OK

Then run restart64.exe file (only tested this with 64 bit windows), which will reset all your monitors.

After your monitors have reset, and all are alive and online, right click your desktop and select Display Settings.

Scroll down and click Advanced Display settings for your monitors, scroll down to related settings and click on Display adapter properties.

In that, click the monitor tab, and there set your gaming monitor to its highest setting.

Click ok, then reboot.

Voila! Your gaming monitor SHOULD be in 120/144hz mode now, and you can freely clone it with your capture hardware without it reverting to 60hz either.

For some reason if you try setting the refresh rate in the Nvidia control panel, it errors up and can't be done.

Hope this helps! "

I am having a major pain in the bum issue to troubleshoot. Since upgrading to Windows 10, I've started getting very odd computer freezing issues. I used to get rare TDR events back at 8.1 but those freezes are quite disturbing. Only way out is reset button.

Now to the point where it gets interesting. Those crashes were happening every ten or so minutes while playing games or using GPU accelerated applications. Out of desperation, I rolled back to the GTAV Game-ready drivers, 350.12 which stopped crashes.

Then I decided to try and troubleshoot further with newer drivers. Installed 355.80 again and computer ran flawlessly for a day, until Win10 decided to update itself, even though I disabled every possible update mechanism of Windows, then the next day, computer crashed again.

After that, I've clean installed the drivers again which gave me two days of crash-free experience.

At the end of the two day period, crashes start again and frequency is back to 10 minutes. After that, clean installing driver gives me two more days and cycle repeats itself.

I have my GTX 970 since 28 of may, it's 3 months old.

Since when I started using it, every game I used to play was perfect. Either at constant 60 fps or even more! At low temps, sometimes at a low gpu usage and sometimes at a fully 100% usage, but some thing have turned over since some time.

After I discovered the existence of [DSR](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/dsr/technology) at around the end of july, I got fucking amazed out of it, even imagining what scale of screenshots I could take on games I used to play most (Batman Arkham Knight, Battlefield, GTA V, etc), so I went for it. And it had actually gave me better performance running at 4K, even more at Batman Arkham Knight.

After some days, playing on my native res (1600x900), I noticed most of the games had been dropped around 10 fps, but it didn't affect much, but then at the start of august, I had to go back to school and I didn't use my PC much.

Time was passing and passing and new NVidia Driver updates were coming and coming, and until a week ago, I really became desperate to see that my GTX 970 is currently running worse on a lot of games than my 9800 GT was.

CS:GO used to run at 300 fps on my GTX 970, now it runs at weirdly 100 fps and drops down to 60~70 and goes to 45 some times, it really gets bad if I'm playing on zoo and I make a rush to B, or if I'm playing at de_747 as TR and I make a rush to the entrance of the plane and look to the cabin at my right will drastically drop my fps down to 45.

And not to mention that I can't play minecraft with more than 40 fps and it stuttering and freezing to 8 fps.

Press Start+R and type in msconfig.exe.
Under the boot tab select boot into safe mode. Then restart when prompted.
Run DDU and select NVIDIA as the driver. Select 'clean and restart'.
Once you're back into windows you want to install the latest Nvidia drivers for your 970.
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART. Select custom installation and UNTICK GEFORCE EXPERIENCE. THIS PART IS CRUCIAL.

There's a bug at the moment with either Windows itself or Nvidia drivers where many displays (mostly 4K displays connected over HDMI) will cause extremely bad flickering in legacy menus, and erratic starting/stopping mouse movement. For me, it has happened ever since launch on any WHQL drivers, or the last 2 hotfixes(355.80/355.83), all on a clean Win10 install.


If so, go to your Mouse options in the legacy Control Panel, and turn on Mouse Trails. You'll notice that the issue stops completely.

He has received no such response since and is concerned he wont receive his game within release.

It took me AGES to get it working through HDMI as opposed to VGA (that only supports 1080p), and I moved yesterday, so the BIOS reset or something, forgetting the settings I had. I feel like an IDIOT, I had no idea how I did it last time, and now it's broken again.

Basically, Nvidia Control Panel thinks I have 2 (of the same) monitor when I plug in both HDMI and VGA. First I tried simple things, setting the HDMI monitor as primary. Nothing. Duplicate display, then try something? Nothing.

I am shit out of luck here, HDMI will not ever work. If I unplug the VGA cable, HDMI shows nothing despite it having claimed I have two monitors not five seconds ago.

There were some rumors on the Nvidia forums that Nvidia's newest drivers will become progressively worse for your card to make people upgrade to new cards.  Now I don't know about that conspiracy theory but I do know that this older driver works extremely well for my 770 GTX but Windows 10 automatically upgrades the driver and I have no way to stop it.  I  did find a little [program](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930) that Microsoft has released to enable you to hide an update.   So this does work BUT if you restart the computer you will be notified that Windows has updated the Nvidia graphics driver again.  So every time I boot up I have to run this program and hide the update using the program first thing.  This is very annoying, and especially if I forget to use the program and Windows updates causes me to go through the process of removing the old driver (and everything it installs, like Gforce Experience and everything else I don't want on my computer since Windows does not give me the option of doing a custom install.

nvidia,Fusyion,10,6,"When G-Sync is enabled, World of Warcraft doesn't go over 20 FPS (Windows 10).This problem goes away when I restart, but it's usually back the same day or the day after. When I disable G-Sync the FPS locks back up to 144 (my monitor refresh rate). With G-Sync enabled the FPS goes up to 144 when I unfocus the application (click on Chrome for example), but back to 20 when I focus on it. This happens only in windowed mode (with G-Sync set to ""windowed and full screen"" mode).

The only place it also happens is in any Unity3D created application and Visual Studio.

My system specs:

* GPU: 2x EVGA GTX 980 Ti in SLI
* Driver version 355.60 
* Windows 10 Pro

This issue started happening when I upgraded to Windows 10 and not only with the drivers I'm currently running.

I have tried a variety of things:

* Turning G-Sync off and on again (no fix)
* Re-installing my drivers (no fix)
* Restarting PC (problem goes away for a little while)
* Enabling ShadowPlay (the problem goes away till I disable ShadowPlay)
* Drag the game to another (non G-Sync) screen (FPS goes back up to V-Sync cap, 60).
* Changing G-Sync to ""full screen mode"" only makes the problem go away (because G-Sync isn't active on windowed applications).

I was wondering if anyone has had the same issue. Advice is welcome too. Thank you.

Edit: I have tried some of the suggestions below, such as forcing on V-Sync and switching from multi-display to single. Unfortunately my V-Sync was already forced globally on and changing the multi-display to single didn't help either. I'm now at a point where I can switch refresh rate (144 Hz -&gt; 100 Hz), turn on ULMB (disabling G-Sync), turn G-Sync back on, and set the refresh rate back to 144 Hz for the problem to go away for a while."

In my experience this was caused by the NVIDIA Streamer service.

I saw two occurrences of this issue: 

* The NVIDIA Streamer service was stopped
* It is not working properly.

Since I always stop/disable that service before I do anything once GFE is installed, I was not able to start Shadowplay.

What I did to fix Was: 

* Open services.msc
* Find the NVIDIA Streamer Service
* Start it if it's stopped/disabled or Restarted if it is already started.
* Try to activate Shadowplay again

I did that, activated shadowplay and it's working now, I even went back and disabled NVIDIA Streamer Service. Keep in mind if you disable it (Service) again you will have to enable it (service) if you want to re-enable Shadowplay in the future, in case you disabled it (shadowplay) for some reason.

Yesterday however I came home and now these same games are barely (read: not) playable.  I'm experiencing terrible FPS, in game UI lag (menus taking forever to respond), and even mouse/sound lag while in game.

I've tried uninstalling and clean installing the 353.30 driver but the same problem exists.

nvidia,ANCIENT-ALIEN,18,6,"980 Ti and Battlefield 4...low GPU usageHi guys,

I'm having some performance issues in BF4. Basically, my new 980 Ti only has a GPU usage of say, 40-65%. 
This is with an overclocked 2500K at 4,0k, win 8.1, 1080p 144hz.

See screenshot (second number = 48% GPU usage): http://i.imgur.com/YNAg9AJ.jpg

I only display the 1st and 2nd CPU cores of my 2500k, but they are not maxed out either. Note the third number is my fan speed.

Game settings are all ultra with 2x MSAA. I have however noted that putting them lower does almost nothing in FPS, which is very odd.

Interestingly, I can increase the GPU usage by upscaling the resolution. At 140% it will actually go over 80% and into 90%. At 200% it will go 97-99% - as normal. So yeah 140% resolution is about the same fps as 100...

Anyone have experience with this problem? 

As far as I have tested this ONLY occurs in Battlefield 4. I can play the Witcher 3 maxed (2x AA) with 100 fps or so, and with a constant 99% GPU usage (CPU numbers are similar to BF4)."

I currently have a 4770K and a GTX 680 along with 16 GB of RAM. I would love to do a 4K setup, but I still just don’t think the technology is there to have a single GPU PC run a game at 4K on maxed out settings with a decent frame rate. From all the benchmarks I have seen, a single 980 Ti just can’t handle 4K with settings turned up about as high as can go. My 680 can just barely run the newer games at High - Very High settings at 1080p, so I could probably get away with running Fallout 4 at somewhat decent settings with the PC I have now. In other words, I don’t have to buy something as soon as possible just to play Fallout 4 when it comes out. I have been looking into 2K monitors and actually wouldn’t mind having one seeing as how GPU technology is finally starting to get to where we can play games at 2K resolution with all settings to the maximum and still have decent frame rates.

Anyways, what I'm asking is this: Should I wait for the Pascal GPU release to see if it can handle 4K resolution and then buy into it if it can, or should I just go with a 980 Ti which has no problem handling 2K resolution? Do you think the Pascal GPU’s will be good enough to do 4K gaming at max settings? Because if so, I can wait for them.

nvidia,EazyCheeze1978,19,13,"Is there an easy way to conclusively tell when a video card has gone bad?Hi all! Have a question, I've had a bit of an issue recently with my Geforce 750 Ti... I got it last year around this time or maybe back in May. It's worked GREAT so far, but since I've started playing Batman: Arkham Knight, and gotten pretty far into it, at a certain point there is a case of polygonal artifacts, in which multi-colored stretched polygons flash wildly where a map display should be.

Is this a sign that the game, which I understand has quite a few issues of its own, is taxing my video card beyond how it should go? I have everything on Low - and in that I'm surprised as on the whole the game still looks great, except for the longer delay in loading the higher-quality textures in some places while loading them quickly in others.

Also, I've just gotten a new Portal 2 mod, Portal Stories: Mel; seems pretty cool but every time I pass through a portal I get a couple polygon artifacts again, just for a second, and also the frame rate seems to hitch quite a bit, which is strange for a Source-engine game, which usually run at 60fps at all times.

Anyway, back to the problem in my title. To be clearer, is there a diagnostic program I can use to tell if/when my card is in imminent danger of failing? :)

While in Chrome and running the weather channel 'Weather in Motion' maps and middle click scrolling down my facebook news feed as fast as it can go, the GPU core clock red lines and I get a black screen.  This only happens if the weather channel map and facebook are in different windows, with both being able to be displayed on the screen at the same time.  There isn't always a 'driver crash' message, but sometimes there is.  This didn't happen in Firefox or IE when I tested them and it doesn't happen in Chrome when I disable my overclock. 

So my question is, is this a sign of instability or an issue with Chrome or a driver issue or what?

- Battlefield 4

- Dirty Bomb

And more. The framerates are pretty bad. In GTA I average 50 frames on high settings (turned down after even worse performance on very high/ultra, where most users get about 60 frames, in CSGO I constantly dip below my desired 144fps on lowest settings, on Battlefield 4 I start strong at about 90 fps (still lower than average) and dip down, sometimes hitting 50 on high (again, not even ultra and I turned it down and still nothing) and in Dirty Bomb it's the same old. Hell, in Far Cry 3 I'm not even getting 60fps. It runs better on cards two years older than mine.

I've uninstalled and reinstalled all my drivers. I've unparked my cores, and I've contacted Nvidia support, but they have done jack shit for me.

I've checked if a bottleneck is happening, but I have a i5 4690k, which should never be bottlenecking this card, or, hell, two of these cards. And the low usage also occurs while the CPU usage is sitting comfortably below 90, or even 80. It's sitting at about 60%, like it's overheating, but it's not. It's maybe 60-70 degrees celcius.There is a common issue with GPU usage with the 970 with tons of users, yet Nvidia still has released no fix after more than nine months, and I'm seriously considering switching to AMD right about now.

If you look at my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3bink8/troubleshooting_i_need_your_help_fellow_builders/) you can see that I managed to score **15, 000** in Firestrike 1.1 normal. But now I could only get a shitty **13,500**.

&amp;nbsp;

My [Heaven benchmark](http://i.imgur.com/7SEVuQn.png) is also disappointing.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm have the latest NVIDIA driver installed **353.38** .

I'm feeling anxious about this as this might be a hardware issue. I need your help.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;


**UPDATE 1**: SOme great improvements. After seeing my clock stay at abnormal speeds even on idle, I say fuck it and remove most of my installed programs and reset my bios settings to defaults. I also removed my current nvidia driver via DDU and rolled back to an older version. 

So now I'm running at stock speeds(CPU @ 3.3ghz &amp; GPU @ 1100), older driver(353.06), with no precision or afterburner installed, default NVIDIA control panel  setting. Basically everything is running in default. Now I'm getting a [whooping 2282](http://i.imgur.com/RUEh6QH.png) in Heaven benchmark test at 1080p. I also managed to score a 14 930 in Firestrike which is really close to my initial score. 

I'm seeing a silver lining here however I still haven't tested in an actual game. I will keep this updated.

&amp;nbsp;

**UPDATE 2**: I tested Witcher 3 to check my performance and I got a noticeable increase. At 1980 x 1080p I'm seeing FPS as high as 75 and the lowest is 55, this is on Ultra with Hairworks on. Before I'm barely reaching 62 fps with increased clocks at 1400 and K-boost activated. But my temp is still at 84 on load but it went down to 50 degrees on idle. 

I'm still unsure what caused my GPU to underperform but I'm glad that I'm getting positive results.

I'm currently in the process of setting up a new computer. For the last 15 years ive used ATI and AMD cards, so I have no idea how nvidia drivers work :P Please help!

I've installed the latest geforce drivers for a 980ti for 64 bit windows 10, and all I get is this.

Is there more to the drivers than this? I have a windforce card, where the fans turn off while the card is idle, and it freaking me the fuck out. I know that the card is designed to run like that, but I can even find a temperature monitor or a fan control setting in the drivers.

Is there and hidden advanced driver panel that you need to activate?

edit 1: I went back and did some tinkering and exploring on the interwebs and found that the custom bios i used from overclock.net's 980ti page was slightly incompatible with my card. I reverted it to the stock bios, and then used Maxwell Tweaker to tailor the card how i wanted to. Since then I am getting a stable overclock of 1480mhz Core and 4001mhz VRAM and staying below 75C. Thank you everyone for your concerns about the safety of my card. I only let it get to 91C for a few seconds and immediately turned off the bench mark and reverted back to a bios that only hit mid 70's."

nvidia,unfunnydick,18,8,"Gigabyte G1 980 Ti SOC SLI BenchmarkLast week (or before that) I [submitted a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/3ajzsp/gigabyte_g1_980_ti_soc_benchmark/) indicating the real world benchmark numbers I was seeing with a Gigabyte 980 Ti SOC I ordered from newegg.  The original plan was to keep my Titan X's, but the damn things were bought out from under me on ebay for $975 each (not bad at all), so I stuck it out with the sole G1 which goes great with my Acer XB270HU monitor.

Blah blah blah some extra work bonus money came my way and what the hell I'll try two of these suckers and see what happens.

Here's the format of the post:

1440p Benchmark Title:  G1 980 TI SLI Result (G1 980 Ti Single Card result)

Firestrike:  20187 (15488)

Metro LL:  111 (80)

Mordor:  134 (94.5)

Far Cry 4 all gameworks stuff on:  85 (45)

Uni Heaven:  3077 (1903)

Hitman:  88 (84)

Witcher 3 with hairworks:  85 (58)

GTA 5 very high no grass:  110 (78)

Tomb Raider:  143 (139) that's as high as fps goes with gsync on.

Project Cars 32 race with full spread of weather fx:  83 (77)

Dragon Age Inquisition:  134 (104)

Batman AA: 144 (144) kind of a useless benchmark now

This pairing of cards does spank the original results I saw with my Titan X's.  Mainly because the Titan's would lose their boost clock after hitting 83C in my Fractal R5 case, they don't with the G1's.  These results are out of box figures with no OC applied with MSI or the OCGuru software.

The cards get incredibly hot in the R5 with no exhaust options that the blower reference Titan X's had.  I may be looking at finding a good air cooled case (recommendations are welcome).  Top card under full load hits 84C, bottom card hits 75.  The fans whir up pretty loud during gaming sessions and you can hear them even with game audio on.  [A quick recording of the card noise output when it was running Heaven Benchmark](https://youtu.be/hVX3TwMN2VY).

I am much happier with a one card configuration with this card, it's quieter and my pc internals don't get so hot.  The noise it makes in SLI is too loud for my tastes.  While the performance kick is great, it just doesn't feel worth it...unless I find a good 4K monitor to justify the performance gains, which I'm still holding out for the 4K Gysnc IPS screens announced at Computex."

Specs 

AMD Phenom II X6 1090t

Zotac GTX 970 (ZT-90101-10P)

8 GB ram

MSI K9A2 platinum MOBO (its old but I love it)

things I've done:

Used DDU to remove both my gtx 660 ti drivers and my older ati radeon hd 6870

underclocking core and memory (much less artifacts almost non existant)

Temps idle are 35C high load benchmark or games 68C so not a temp issue

PSU is a antec 750w psu with strong 12V rails

Using latest 352.86 drivers

http://adtech.com/show/9306/the-nvidia-geforce-gtx-980-ti-review/14

&gt;As for texel and pixel fillrates, the results are both as-expected and a bit surprising. On the expected side, we see the GTX 980 Ti trail GTX Titan X by a bit, again taking a hit from the SMM loss. On the other hand we’re seeing a larger than expected drop in the pixel fill rates. GTX 980 Ti loses some rasterization throughput from the SMM loss, but a 15% drop in this test is much larger than 2 SMMs. Just to be sure we checked to make sure the ROP/MC configuration of GTX 980 Ti was unchanged at 96 ROPs, so we’re at a bit of a loss to explain the difference at this time.

TechReport's investigation into the GTX 970:

http://techreport.com/blog/27143/here-another-reason-the-geforce-gtx-970-is-slower-than-the-gtx-980

&gt;So the GTX 970's peak potential pixel fill rate isn't as high as the GTX 980's, in spite of the fact that they share the same ROP count, because the key limitation resides elsewhere. When Nvidia hobbles the GTX 970 by disabling SMs, the effective pixel fill rate suffers."

Apologies if this isn't the right place for this, but I'm not sure where to post this.

After I got my GTX760 and tried Shadowplay, I noticed something odd. I recorded some Mechwarrior Online, and when I watched it back, I couldn't believe the framerate. It was as smooth as butter. The FPS was the same it's always been while playing, but watching it back, I was astonished at the smoothness. It was as though I wasn't seeing all the frames while playing.

I tried watching the recording on multiple monitors, same result- super-smooth.

I couldn't figure it out, so left it at that. This weekend, though, I hooked the PC up to my 49"" LG TV to play The Witcher 3 from my couch. I usually only manage around 38-45fps, but when I played the game on the TV, I got that ""smooth-as-butter"" feeling again, like I suddenly saw more than 24fps or something. I put it back on the 24"", and the feeling is lost, despite both having the same graphical settings at 1080, no frame limiting or V-Sync in place, and hitting the same framerate.

Is this all in my head? Am I just used to a monitor, and don't realize that the FPS is great? Could it be my eyes? It's like I'm seeing over 30fps for the first time in my life, and I love it.

I tried googling for it, but it all just lead to forum fights over whether the human eye can see over 24fps. I'd love some insight? I definitely see 60fps when watching high-framerate movies etc, and definitely noticed when Youtube videos starting releasing in 60fps, so I *can* see it, just not when playing on my monitor.

tl;dr: I don't see that ""smoothness"" from &gt;30fps unless I'm watching my Shadowplay recordings, or playing on my TV. Is my brain broken?

nvidia,Krooksy,18,8,"Which GTX980Ti would you choose for watercoolingHello,

I've been on a watercooled GTX680 for a while now and have been following the 980Ti for a little while. I've decided that this will be my next card but the prices are quite steep over here in the UK and I'll be watercooling it too (more money).


Would you -

A - Spend less and go for a base model with stock cooler and therefore stock clock speeds and attempt to overclock to and beyond the factory overclocked cards levels?


or


B - Go for a factory overclocked model and be guaranteed at least a slightly higher binned chip and 100+ Mhz overclock. Is most of the difference in money for these cards in the cooler alone?"

The debate ultimately is this... I am on a budget but dont want to buy something that will flop soon.  I know future proofing isn't worth buying on...

The evidence is Shadow of Mordor or The Evil Within.  So-

Is 300 bucks realllly worth it for the 980m 4GB over the 970m 3 GB.  My tech buddy pointed out that I should enjoy the games for the games and simply get something that will play them nicely and not worry if the reflections are *that* much better.  As I type this I think that sounds great.

There's no pattern, really... sometimes it'll be very close to boot-up, after opening Chrome or Steam. Though I can say closing GTA V is pretty much a guarentee that I crash. 

Everything runs great, my temps are all good, but it crashes all the time. Seems like it could be a power thing, and I can't say I truly troubleshooted all 3 of the 6 pins I'm using. It's 1 6 pin and 1 8 pin hookup to the GPU - I'm using a converter the GPU came with to turn 2x 6 into 1x8. There is a 4th 6 pin I can use to diagnose with, but could that actually be the cause?

Any help is appreciated, thanks!

After returning my two 970s and waiting for AMD's new stuff to mull them over, I got sick of sitting on my hands and just got the stupid Titan X.

It's very good so far. very happy with it.

I've been playing a lot of GTAV, but last night before bed I fired up a couple other games to set their settings and procrastinate instead of sleep..

When running Alien isolation at the desired settings, (2880P everything everything etc) I noticed the output of my machine was quite hot (hotter than Im used to)

I checked temps and it was hovering around 80-82c.

Now I know the spec sheet says 91c is the max temp, but this seems sort of..close to that? unless I'm overreacting.


It didn't exceed that temp even after screwing around in game for a while. so I guess it's a stable 80-82.. I'm just not used to that sort of heat I guess.

before it's asked my case has excellent cooling and ventilation etc etc. no other component goes above 38c ever. 

Hate to be a worrier. I'd just like some reassurance I guess.

Loving the card though. very happy with it if unhappy to be roped back into the evil corporation..

No graphical glitches or anything. I was reading a benchmark though where they only set it to +100mhz and were getting around the same framerates I get in games. So I tried the same, and I noticed right off the bat that my peak power consumption dropped from 106% to 94%, which is giving me a lot more headroom to up the voltage and core clock.

anyone else experience anything similar? Is having the memory clock raised even useful?"

I've tried researching it, but I guess I'm just not quite smart enough to understand the phrasing people have used. If I tick FXAA on, is it getting used alongside more antialiasing, or is it just that? 

Additionally under things like ""Antialiasing - Setting"" , it only gives me x2, x4, etc. But what KIND of antialiasing is it?

My second display is a 1080p projector connected to a Yamaha 7.1 receiver (with the Yamaha receiver having an HDMI run to the PC), which I need to connect to one of the DisplayPort connections left on my card.

When I plug the receiver into the HDMI 2.0 port, Control Panel shows 7.1 sound as an option (of course, I can't keep it connected that way since I need that port for my 4k display).  When I plug the receiver into one of the DisplayPort ports, via a DP 1.1 to HDMI 1.4 adapter, I only get 2 channel as an option, which won't work, since I use surround sound on the receiver when gaming on the projector.

It's possible that the reason I see only 2 channel audio support over DP -&gt; HDMI is because I'm using a DP 1.1 adapter, rather than a 1.2.  However, I can't find conclusive spec sheets anywhere that say whether the GTX9xx series supports 7.1 audio over DisplayPort 1.2 in the first place, or if it only supports stereo over DisplayPort.

Before I go drop $30 on another cable that explicitly says it supports 7.1 in the conversion process from DP to HDMI (http://www.startech.com/media/products/DP2HD4KS/PDFs/DP2HD4KS_Datasheet.pdf), I'm hoping someone here is running the 900 series cards to drive 7.1 sound over DP -&gt; HDMI and could confirm that's even possible.  Otherwise, every time I want to move from using the 4k60 display at my desk to using my projector and surround, it looks like I'm going to have to get back behind the PC and swap the other device into the HDMI 2.0 port.

It's a damn good workhorse for a laptop, and it gets the job done when it comes to gaming and 3D modeling. GeForce Experience recognizes the specs just fine as you can see from this screenshot. http://i.imgur.com/20JL8f6.png ShadowPlay seems to be supported, and I have the green check mark, except for the processor. Now while my i7 is clocked at a measly 2.30GHz it does turbo up to 3.30GHz, so I think it's still beefier than the listed i3 @ 3.10GHz. Notice how the processor is the only thing not checked off. So somehow, I think that GeForce Experience is getting thrown off my my processor, since the ShadowPlay switch does nothing when it is pressed. It just stays grey and useless. Same thing with my ShadowPlay settings in the preferences menu. http://i.imgur.com/eIrWL6t.png Greyed out and unresponsive to clicks.

nvidia,zWeApOnz,37,9,"What are your release time-frame expectations for the next graphics card from NVIDIA? (980ti?)I've seen rumors talking about a new card as early as two months from now, til as late as 2016. But there doesn't seem to be any facts to back up what I've seen thus far.

Here's my deal -- I'm currently sitting on a 295X2, which I love, but doesn't perform well in a few very important games for me. Plus, I really want a single GPU. I also know NVIDIA is where I want to be -- things like NVIDIA Gameworks really get me.

The 980 won't be enough for 1440p gaming at the framerate I am targeting, and the Titan X is overpriced for how I see it perform(my 295X2 can beat it in many games, and it's half the price).

So I know I need a beefy, single GPU. The gap between the 980 and the Titan X is exactly where my market is, and I'm dying to know how long I need to hold out. If I could, I'd buy a new card today.. and I've been close to getting a Titan X, but I know this ""next"" card from NVIDIA is going to be the sweet spot for me.

So, what do you personally think will happen? Will we see a new NVIDIA card, likely the 980ti, in 2015?"

I bought a gtx 970 and it worked well. One day I woke up and my computer screen was solid purple. I restarted the computer and the initial bootscreen (with the motherboard brand and bios buttons) was out of resolution (It was like extending passed what my monitor could see, like super zoomed in) and I couldn't read or see anything. I entered the bios and the same thing was going on. Restarted, same issue, tried to boot normally and my PC would freeze at windows logo loading screen. Booted safe mode, uninstalled drivers via guru's uninstall software and tried to boot normal mode. Worked fine. Reinstalled drivers. Worked fine.

Three weeks later, same thing, only this time it was much more serious. I did all the steps that fixed it last time only this time when I installed the new nvidia drivers after fixing the issue, the computer started artifacting really bad and it didn't fix the boot screens or anything. Lines were continuously streaming across my monitor. 

I considered the card dead and RMA""d it. Welp, I just got an email from EVGA and they said the gtx 970 passed all test and works fine. They will still send me a replacement card but, the card works fine.

Why was it artifacting on my computer?"

Formatted my HDD and did a clean install. The computer works until I install the drivers (I tried the ones that come with the CD), as soon as it flashes to change resolution it goes black. 

Tried another power supply, same thing. 

It works fine in safe mode. 

It works without the drivers.

Changed PCI slots. Same ""error"".

It works with the IGPU, only if I first unplug the power from the card.

I run a significant overclock on both my CPU and GPU which runs most games fairly well on  almost Ultra. Adding streaming into the mix slows things down considerably.

Is there a good method of using a second GPU to encode for streaming or should I look into buying a newer gpu with better capabilities?

nvidia,u60n0,8,1,"[Update] GTX 980 keeps crashing. Do I have a bad card?Last week I posted [this help forum](http://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/2x8vyt/gtx_980_keeps_crashing_do_i_have_a_bad_card/) here because my recent PC upgrade is not going smoothly. I am still having issues so I thought I could get some more opinions.

I bought [a factory OC'd EVGA GTX 980](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814487089), as well as [new RAM](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231314) and [a new PSU]
(http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817152059). Since installing everything, my gaming performance has been... spotty. Last week a lot of game's .exe's were failing and crashing to the desktop (along with a few assorted BSODs). A majority of these were while playing TitanFall, so I figure I can attribute some of that to the game itself (I've read it has a lot of issues).

When messing with my Memory Timing settings (as per someone's advice) [my motherboard](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130235) blew out one of my old RAM sticks, leaving me with 12GB total instead of 16.

After playing a few more games, my crashes have become less frequent, but now I'm realizing that my performance is terrible. I've tried a variety of games and most of time my frames sit around 30FPS. In Crysis 3 and Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, my frames regularly drop into the teens. This is not OK. My old GTX 580 performed waaaay better than this, even when it was dying. 

I thought that dropping over half a grand on a top level GPU would finally give me the performance I'm looking for, and now I don't know what to think about this. I'm very frustrated because I can't figure out what the issue is. I don't think it's a memory issue anymore, so that leaves either GPU or PSU (or Mobo, but I doubt it)... if anyone can give me any advice on how to figure this out, I would be forever in your debt.

I've been benchmarking in GPU-Z and I noticed that during gameplay my GPU load fluctuates wildly from around 3% all the way up to 40%, and it seems totally random. Most of the time is seems that its operating under 40% though. Shouldn't this thing be running in the upper 90%s when I'm running Crysis 3 on Ultra????? 

Maybe it's not getting enough power from the 12V rail, though I don't have any idea how to test that. Maybe the card is a dud and just won't perform. Thoughts???"

I'm using Gmod in this example, but this applies to any 3D game really.

Why do no games in existence have the option to just turn texture filtering OFF.
Not to bilinear, **OFF**.
And I can't do it from my GPU settings either

Maybe I just don't want to have blurry textures. Why do game devs act like this is fucking forbidden?
It seems like ever since it became a thing devs used it just because it was available, even when they hire a professional pixel artists to make the textures they ruin all their work by applying these stupid fucking filters over them. 
This is why [PS1 looked WAY better](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-77kLRYhVmy4/UuQDThZI-YI/AAAAAAAAM7c/HdTSg_Y6HDA/s1600/PSX_VS_N64___megaman_legends___by_Elias1986.png) than the N64 despite being much less powerful.

Google has been no fucking help at all, the only answers I could find outside of ""why would you want to do that it would look ugly HUUURRRRRRR"" was to increase the filter to the maximum.

But at that point... WHY HAVE A FUCKING FILTER HOLY SHIT FUCK THESE PEOPLE.

Back on my shield, I just see a black screen and cannot control anything.  After 20 seconds or so, I get a ""cannot connect to PC"" error.  I then am booted back to the Hub PC game selection screen and can quit the game I was playing.  If I quit the game, the game closes on my computer.

I've tried:

* Uninstalling/re-installing GFE
* Uninstalling/re-installing drivers with DDU
* Rebooting driver
* Delecting the Game Stream certificate and restarting the Streamer server using certmgr.msc

My shield used to work great, I was even able to play remotely.  The only thing I could think of is that Nvidia gimped non-5g routers.

Its becuase i was using a beta version of geforce experience, but not the beta version of the shield hub.

And better yet, to get shield hub beta, you have to sign up for and use google+ to be able to join the program. so basically you have to share all your information with nvidia to get it....

so im just not going to use beta geforce experience then lol.

How is it not better documented that you need to have matching versions of geforce experience and shield hub for it to work? how is that not like the #1 thing listed under troubleshooting... i can see this very easily happening, as you cant easily get access to beta shield hub like you can beta geforce experience.

In home streaming is a big deal.  Sure, the tech isn't where it needs to be yet, but I think nvidia has a leg up on the competition with their shield product line, and I think an HDMI dongle would be a great addition to that product line.

Also, the tech support guy I spoke with, I think his name was Jonathan, said he personally uses an evga card because their step up support policy was great! Ha. 

I received a response to my escalation today from Tom Wang, who said, ""as our Product Managers and higher management have already been awared [sic] of the situation, we currently strive to conclude a resolution internally. Unfortunately, and also given the uniqueness of this matter, it may take some time to consolidate a plan to address the matter, thus my recommendation, at this point, is to notify our technical support, and perhaps request a case number which I see you have already been doing. Besides this, I am afraid I cannot offer you any official response as of right now."" 

Anyone had better luck? Maybe /u/bbqwoa has something to add to this?

Update: I received this email from Asus this morning (Jan. 30).

Hi, I have issued a case number for you in regards this matter, ######, it has recorded all our communication took in place here, and you may use it for future reference.

A consolidate plan has been proposed, it is awaiting for higher management approval. Once all these internal process has been completed, a formal response will be announced, and remedy action will be taken if any.
Thanks kindly for your understanding and patience

Since my ~3 years old [Gigabyte Radeon HD 7970 OC](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4290#ov) slowly reaches it's limits im thinking about something new. Due to the fact that i had a 'load of trouble with the AMD GPU drivers in the past im pretty sure that my next card(s) will be NVIDIA ones. 

Now i have two mostly 2 and a half topics i want to talk about.

The first (and a half) one is the Space in my RIG and the way SLI works. 

Here is a little [album](http://imgur.com/a/DemSs) about the space i have and the SLI connectors i got so far beside the ones that will come with the GPU's 


As references it is a [ASUS Rampage IV Extreme](http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/RAMPAGE_IV_EXTREME/) with a [Gigabyte Radeon HD 7970 OC](http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4290#ov) and a [ASUS Xonar Phoebus](http://www.asus.com/Sound_Cards/ROG_Xonar_Phoebus/). 

Since the [Noctua NH-D14 SE 2011](http://www.noctua.at/main.php?show=productview&amp;setlng=en&amp;products_id=41&amp;news_id=) does block the first PCI-E port i just have 5 left. the first two will basicly be blocked by 1 GPU and im not sure if it would be smart to put them directly below each other without space as you can see on one of the pictures. 

-&gt;&gt; **DL;DR:** Will two GPU's fit my case with the Soundcard or could i get trouble in terms of temperature?

______

My next question is the SLI thingy. I one of the connectors looks prettymuch like the AMD Crossfire one but since i never used that im just asking if they have to fit perfectly or if i can stretch them because it could be a bit problematic to place 2 gpu's perfectly. 

____

My last question is about the GPU Itself. I definitly would like to go for a SLI configuration that can keep at least 60 fps in tripple A titles for a good amount of time. I dont really care about ultra or medium settings.

The secound most important thing beside gaming is video rendering. But since every(?) current GPU supports CUDA that shouldnt be that much of a problem. Budget should be around minimum 500€ each GPU up to ~800€. "

Initial Question: Hello - it's recently made news that the NVidia 970 graphics card I ordered was advertised with incorrect specifications. Ordinarily this might not matter since it's a nice card, but it does make a noticable difference when used with a 4K monitor (like the one I purchased in the same order). I'd like to know if I can return it for credit towards the next model up - even though it's been used for a couple of weeks now. Many other retailers are allowing exceptional returns due to this circumstance.

09:49 AM PST Sergiu(Amazon): Hello, my name is Sergiu. I'm here to help you today.

09:50 AM PST Sergiu(Amazon): Yeah, I heard the news on neogaf. I've been following it up since I wanted to upgrade but now..I'm not so sure. I can certainly assist with return label for it. Should I proceed with it? 

09:52 AM PST ScribbleJ: Sure, thank you. For what it's worth, it's a very nice card -- the general consensus seems to be it only matters if you're using a high resolution monitor.

09:53 AM PST Sergiu(Amazon): Yeah but its not really worth the risk for a year..if I'm gonna upgrade I'd rather be sure it holds me for at least 2-3 years, and with the terrible ports that might come ( ACUNITY ) its a risk I'm not sure I can take. But thats besides the point and just a bit of personal rant. Will the return be a drop off or a pickup? 

09:55 AM PST ScribbleJ: I'll take it to the nearby UPS store, so I guess that's a drop off. My wife is watching this chat and she is amazed that you know about the issue - she wants to know if I just happened to get a support person who is interested in the Nvidia cards, or if you know EVERYTHING. Or do these requests get routed to people with special training on the product?

09:59 AM PST Sergiu(Amazon): I'm actually surprised you're the first person regarding this whole gtx 970 issue that I've hand since it all started. I do not know everything, but I do know this particular issue because I'm a PC gamer and I do frequent NeoGaf forums and other websites and I was genuinely interested in upgrading my 760 to 970 once I got some money to spare and I've been following it ever since. ANyway, I've issued the return label for you which I'll be emailing it shortly. 

10:02 AM PST ScribbleJ: Thank you very much! One last question - I assume I'll just return it and get the money back when Amazon receives it, so I can go ahead and order a 980 right now? 

10:04 AM PST Sergiu(Amazon): Yep, once we receive and process the return you'll be refunded, and yes you can safely order a 980 ( lucky!! ). 
Is there anything else that I might be able to assist you with ScribbleJ? 

10:05 AM PST ScribbleJ: That's everything. You've been awesome! I hope you get your own rig upgraded the way you want soon. :)

nvidia,CarrotPunch,2,2,"GTX760 frame drop due to adaptive clockHi everyone,   
Basically my 760 has frame drops in non-demanding games like ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Deus Ex: Human revolution"",using riva tuner overlay,i noticed that it occurs due to the lowering in both core and memory clock speed.    
It seems like that the card doesn't detect load on those games and turn itself into a power saving mode :\   
I tried to overclock it manually,but the dynamic clock change still occurs.    

Is there a way to solve this issue,or at least make the card run at a fixed overclock?    
    
Thanks in advance.

I though ""meh, maybe it's not that bad"". My parts came on Wednesday, and I put it together. And unfortunately, it's really, really bad. Playing Dying Light (1.2.1), and whenever I hit that magical number of 3.5GB of VRAM usage, I get INCREDIBLY bad stutters, the game is actually unplayable. So I decided to get on the phone, and see what NCIX's current policy on returns is for the 970.

I was told by the representative that there will be a public announcement in the next few days about the 970, on the NCIX forums, and on the Nvidia forums, and to hold tight until then. (Currently, the return policy is the same for any other item, but I'm hoping that changes.)

**EDIT**: Also filled out a ticket with Gigabyte, they replied with this

&gt;Dear Joeeeh,

&gt;Thank you for contacting GIGABYTE about your complaint. We are aware of your concerns and currently working with NVIDIA. NVIDIA has confirmed that the performance of the GTX-970 GPU is not affected. The 4GB of RAM is fully accessible, however, accessed differently. Please review the following link that has been updated with detailed information regarding the issue.

&gt;We have forwarded your request over to our service team and will notify you once a process is put in place to help GIGABYTE customers that are not completely satisfied with the product because of these concerns.

&gt;Thank you for choosing GIGABYTE.

nvidia,thePhysicist8,5,3,"Performance scaling at higher resolutions? (Yes, it's about my 970...)Right now, I'm using a 24"" 1080p 60Hz panel with my 970 Strix. The initial intention was to eventually upgrade to 1440p and/or 120+Hz, although the memory cap certainly throws a wrench in things.

Rendering at 1440p should be 1.78x more resource-intensive than 1080p, which is huge. I'd be effectively locked at the resolution, and thus have a much higher minimum performance impact. If I wanted to upscale to it, it would have to be from 720p, which is an abysmally low PPI at 27"". Native 1440p will obviously look better than any AA voodoo magic I can use on my 1080p monitor. The issue is determining *how much* better it will look, and if that justifies the performance hit given my GPU specs. With newer AA methods, you can go a long way with little performance impact at 1080p.

For those of you with 1440p+ monitors, what has your experience been like? How much AA can you get away with? I'm a snob for texture resolution and filtering, so how's wall-licking at higher resolutions? Most importantly: how has it impacted your memory usage? I love my card to death, but I'm concerned (like everyone else) that VRAM will end up being the limiting factor.

Now, after hearing about the 970 issues, I am at a huge dilemma. I don't want to spend more than 400$, but I think I might have to. 

I could buy one of the new AMD GPU's... Also multiple more months that I don't really want to wait.

I could go with a 970 and hope that it does not fail me, also lots of potential problems seeing as I hope to not have to buy a new GPU for at least 3 years.

I could go with a 980, but they are very very expensive. 

My final option is a 960, but I don't know how worth it the thing will be for long term use.

1. Open up your NVidia Control Panel. Under the Display hierarchy tree  look for ""Adjust desktop color settings"", choose your main monitor (if you use more than one like I do you'll want to do this for each and every monitor). 

1. ""Choose how color as set."" leave all these the same, go down to step three. 

1. ""Apply the following enhancements:"" crank Digital Vibrance to 75%. Hit apply.

Do this for all your monitors (if you use multiple like me).

The effect looks best on LCD monitors, but it works well on CRT's as well, but I'm not sure any of us still use CRT's..

You'll have to do this every single time you get a graphics card driver, but it's worth doing every single time.


Enjoy your new sharper display!

nvidia,dorfcally,10,1,"Bought a 960 after my last gpu fried itself, first time using nvidia... how should I use the fan control to keep everything cool and quiet?The 960 has a built in feature so that the fans don't turn on until it reaches 60c, but I don't really like that so I downloaded the program for fan control. Right now I have it so the fans are idle until 40c (computer idles at about 25c), 10% at 55c, 20% at 60c, then 40% at 70c, but I'm hoping it never goes above 60 unless I'm really pushing it.

Right now it goes to about 55~ when on Dying Light with medium to max settings. I understand that this card is a budget mid-range card so I'm not trying to push it to the limits or anything, but the fans still get pretty loud even though they're supposed to be quiet. I was kinda surprised that they got so loud so fast, but I probably don't know what I'm doing. Am I doing something wrong or was I just overestimating the card?

nvidia,Ruedeagler,20,3,"970 3.5gb problem: dae really noticed anything while gaming?So i read a lot about the problem, i read people complaining they were unable to play watchdogs or shadows of mordor with high quality textures at 4k..

i thought this may be too much for a single 970 (/some software problem like fast driving in watchdogs) and not a vram issue

so i tested it with bf4@4k@ultra settings.
i have a g1 gaming and overclocked it with afterburner
+150 core
+500 memory

i had 35fps average, min 31 and sometimes more than 40 or even 50. 
my vram usage was 3,6gb most of the time with peaks up to 4gb but the game was still playable. when switching from desktop to the game i had my fps dropped to 5 for a few seconds but after that it went up to 35 again.

running the benchmark showed low gb/s above 3,5gb but ingame i couldnt notice anything bad. 

tldr:
even with vram usage &gt;3,5gb i'm still having good fps

i'm not going to get a refund for my card, it's a great card for a great price and if people want to play at 4k with everything cranked up they shouldn't have picked a 970"

I got the monitor for the high refresh rate more than anything else.  I had some gift certificates laying around, so I decided to splurge on the 3D kit, and while support isn't perfect (which I'm used to, I also run SLI and 2D Surround) for most games, it's PHENOMENAL.  The high refresh rate makes a huge difference to me over my 3DTV, and the number of games that work with 3D relative to what's out there for my TV is just incredible.  This blows the doors off of PS3+3DTV and TriDef+3DTV (SLI Support, I'm sure TriDef would be fine on high refresh monitors relative to TV).  So, I have two questions for the community- 1) wait for Oculus or get two more of these monitors, and 2) How quickly is the ""new car smell"" going to fade from this - is it secretly crappy but I'm just too new to 3DVision to know it yet?"

I've noticed that most of the titles that are featured in the Shield hub are primarily older titles like Half-Life 2 and Episode 1, Portal, GTA Chinatown Wars, Knights of the Old Republic, etc. These are great games and I can see them selling well, but I don't really see them getting people to buy a shield tablet/portable as a gaming device. Especially since you can get these games on other platforms.

I guess the problem I see is that it's hard to get people to develop software for Shield because there are only so many Tablets/Portables that have been sold and if that number is low, why develop a game specifically for that device?

Another problem I see is Google. While I prefer Android to iOS(I think I need to rinse my keyboard after typing iOS), Google is more interested in developing Google Play as a general marketplace and not developing it as marketplace for gaming like Steam is.

I have 3 acer236 models...1920x1080 5ms ips. My single 770 4gb can run surround but again, turning everything on low and putting up with little or no AA.

Budget is about 1200. I am open to upgrading the center monitor with the purchase of one card. Or buying two cards.

My two questions are:
1. If I bought two cards, how or which display port cable do I buy when these monitors only have a dvi and hdmi connections. Converters aren't cheap and I don't know if that's how everyone else does it or if you degrade the signal connect contraptions between the monitor and card.

2. Will a single 980 allow me to run my games in surround with max 1080p settings, or will I still have to turn stuff down.

I always play in full screen and cap fps to 60 and vsync on.

2. Setting the global setting to use the Nvidia card in the control panel.

3. BIOS setting for graphic options.

4. Tried the startup time for two Nvidia services through task manager &gt; services. Both didn't show up (update helper was one i think).

5. Laptop is plugged in and battery set to performance.

Disabling the Integrated graphics leaves me with a horrible resolution on the dedicated gpu and no way to change it. GeForce optimizes the games like it did on Win7, but when I launch them I get about 6 fps max. I think something is wrong with the GPU or some driver. The current driver is 347.25"

nvidia,billjanke,16,1,"My Experience GTX 970 Successful ReturnHi All,

Let me state that the issue I have had with the GTX 970 isn't based on performance on otherwise a great card for most purposes. Simply the whole issue is based on principles alone and being lied to more than anything.  So far it is how Nvidia has responded in regards to the matter that has really irked me.

I have been a Nvidia consumer for as long as I can remember.   This isn't to say that AMD provides bad products or support.  On the contrary, this is far from it. It's just all my informed purchases at the time had pointed me in the direction of Nvidia based on serveral articles and benchmark specs.  

At this point, I figured to simply return the graphics card and that's it.  Some of you might suggestwhy not upgrade to a GTX 980. But again as mentioned with my point above the thought of giving Nvidia more money by buying a GTX 980 is even a worse though.  Especially, once you realize that the GTX 970 gpu is basically the 980 GPU throwaways with the problematic VRAM architecture.

Anyhow, thought I'd share my thoughts on the matter.  At this point, I'd rather have my rather expensive computer components (i7-4790k, etc) serve as a really expensive HTPC and see what the future will hold (NVIDIA apology? AMD 300?).  

Of course I could get a bargain on the 290x, but I had ruled out that decision a while ago on the purchase of my GTX 970.  Of course I'd be missing out on the Witcher 3 or GTA5 at launch.  But the good news is I wasn't going to play those games for a while as I'm usually awaiting for a price drop on steam after a few years.

All well and good so far.  I like the PNY for the reference design of the card (I like that cooling solution which works well with my system and it is also quiet).

Problem is, near as I can tell, PNY provides no bells and whistles for their card which also means no ability to set the fan to auto-adjust itself based on its temperature.

I downloaded [EVGA Precision](http://www.evga.com/precision/) which seems it is doing the trick.  Still, while looking in to this it seemed Nvidia built in fan controls into their driver.  From the [sales page for the PNY GTX 980](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814133563) card: 

&gt;NVIDIA GPU Boost 2.0 Technology 

&gt;Dynamically maximizes clock speeds based on workload, and allows enthusiast class controls such as temperature target and fan controls, extra over-voltage headroom, and optimizations for water-cooling solutions. This allows greater customization and overclocking options and enables gamers to push performance to new levels. 

So where is that?  When I look at my control panel I [see this screen.](http://i.imgur.com/MbiViWA.png)

So where are these reputed enthusiast controls?  The ones that presumably [should look like this](http://www.nvidia.com/object/performance_group.html)?

I've never experienced much trouble from games ever since I've bought this laptop.

But lately I've been having a really bad experience with x64 games, even if my system meets the minimum requirement the game runs on as low as 5 fps even on the lowest settings.

After an hour of google search I realized that I'm not the only one experiencing this issue. I found a few posts on GeForce forums which seems to have a solution for this particular issue, but it only works for PC's with windows 7, its a registry value fix of a registry that does not exist in windows 8/8.1 !!

* I've tried every possible solution, from dell's ePsa diagnostics to re-installing bios and graphic drivers.

* I have tried turning off the speedstep ( *which supposedly increases the clock speed, but in my case just heats up the card with no real results* )

* I have tried the inbuilt graphic card stress tests, which my card passed. ( *with very low fps btw, almost from 6-20 fps for GT650m, is that normal?* )

* I have tried re-installing all the games with the specific issue.

* I have also tried editing the graphic profile from Nvidia control panel.

* I have tried pleading for help to Nvidia customer support, with no reply.

* I have tried submitting it as a bug on GeForce forums.

Some people have come to a conclusion that this is a driver related issue, and has been occurring ever since the update to 340.75.

Now i don't know if Nvidia is knowingly ignoring this issue or If its an Nvidia issue at all. Or they have just stopped working on fixes for older graphic cards like mine, hoping we would upgrade to PCs with newer cards after were tired of waiting for a fix. I would certainly upgrade, but **never** to another Nvidia card. that's for sure.

So if any of you good people of reddit know of a possible solution, please share!"

Question: 	

Hi GIGABYTE!
I recently upgraded my old GTX 760 (also from GIGABYTE) to the new GTX 970 G1 Gaming. I'm very satisfied with it's performance, amazing graphics card! One thing is bothering me though. 
I have a monitor and a TV hooked up to the graphics card. Monitor for PC stuff, and TV for movies etc. Monitor is connected with DVI and TV is connected with HDMI. On my old card, the DVI display port had priority over HDMI, which meant that, when I wanted to go to my computer BIOS, it would display on my computer monitor. However, with this new graphics card, it seems HDMI has priority, because when I go into BIOS, it's only displayed on my TV, not my monitor. I don't want to crawl to the back of my computer, and disconnect HDMI every time I need to enter BIOS, but apparently, this is the case right now. Is there a way to change the priority? Possibly firmware update, anything? 	

1/7/2015 3:31 PM

Answer: 	

Dear xx xx,

Thank you for your kindly mail and inquiry. Just as you mentioned, the priority output is the HDMI. Since this order is written in the VBIOS, it cannot be altered. We are sorry if there is any inconvenience.

Regards,
GIGABYTE

TL;DR: GIGABYTE acknowledges that HDMI has priority over other ports, which is why black screen is displayed to begin with if two monitors are setup. There is NO fix for this apparently. :("

(one of them is DVI-D)I've been using a 1920x1200 (VGA/DVI) monitor with 560 Ti (1GB) but now I want to add a 2560x1440 monitor that requires dual link DVI. I haven't been able to run both monitors and after some googling, apparently 1GB is not enough to drive two such monitors (or is it?).

I'm wondering if you guys have any suggestions? Should I use the  1200p one with onboard (it has both VGA and DVI)? (I've read in the past that if you have a GPU, it's recommended that you keep your onboard graphics off, I'm not sure if it's a valid advice or not).

(FWIW, I don't do a lot of gaming and even if I have to, I could disconnect the 1200p temporarily)

Thanks in advance.

**EDIT 1**: I forgot to mention, I've already made the 1440p to work with the GPU (with a DVI port which I assume is being used in dual link configuration). But the 1200p is disconnected atm. Maybe I should try it on the spare DVI port. What I meant in my original statement is that I've heard if you connect a 1440p to a 1GB GPU in dual link mode, you cannot use the other DVI port for an extra 1200p display. Maybe I should try this and update this thread.

**EDIT 2**: So I connected the 1200p to the spare DVI port and restarted the system. Windows 7 detected both displays with correct resolutions. I guess I have to now figure out some way to make the setup work in linux (ubuntu doesn't detect the 1200p automatically like windows does)."

First of all, [here](http://pastebin.com/CJVE0hCy) are my system specs.
 
Okay, so now I am going to try to explain what happens whenever I boot my PC.
All goes well until the Windows login screen is shown. I press enter to get to my user and the custom picture goes upwards, lagging. I put my password to enter to Windows and the loading thingy shows up, also lagging.
 
When the desktop is shown, I can start moving my mouse, but it lags a lot. Sometimes I get reports such as ""Display dirver has stopped responding and has recovered"". Below that there appears a text saying this: ""Display driver NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver, Version 344.75 stopped responding and has successfully recovered"".
I have to mention that there is lag not only on my mouse movements, but in Windows generally. For example, I use Windows+C to open the sidebar and it also shows up lagging.

To fix this lag, I need to restart my PC.
When I restart, there is no lag in the login screen, neither in Windows.
 
I uninstalled my GPU drivers and started using the Windows basic one, just to see if the lag dissappeared by not using NVIDIA Drivers.
So, I started in Safemode, and used DDU to uninstall my drivers. Then I switched my PC off. After that, I started in normal mode, while using Windows basic driver, and boom! There was no lag.
 
I decided to install NVIDIA drivers again, and while the installation was in progress, the lag appeared. Exact same lag that I described before.
 
I have reinstalled Windows, formatted... I really don't know what to do. Could it be because of a malfunctioning GPU?
The rare thing is that once I restart, the lag disappears completely and I am able to get (at least) +90 FPS in games like CoD: Advanced Warfare and such.
 
I really don't know what is happening. The one thing I'm quite sure of is that NVIDIA Drivers make my PC/Windows lag and even crash sometimes.

· Malwarebytes scan did not detect any malicious items.

· Uninstalling Nvidia GeForce Experience did not solve anything :(

· Driver rollback (not sure if it's written like that) kind of softens the lag but does not make it disappear.

 
Can anybody help me? :(

I MANAGED TO SOLVE IT!

Well, sorry for the caps, just trying to express my happiness! xD

I read that some OC configurations may run better if set on Gen2 so as my GPU is an OC version I changed that setting at the BIOS.
So with PCI set to ""Gen2"" there is no lag at all! :D (It was set on ""Auto"" btw)

Thanks for all of your replys!"

I'm looking to buy the SHIELD Tablet (32G preferred), but I was hoping that somewhere would be selling it at a discount during this Black Friday/Cyber Monday season. The only discount I found was the one from ThinkGeek, but they were quick to disqualify the SHIELD Tablet from the sale. Much sad.

Installed MSI Afterburner to check what was happening... OSD shows all 4 cores of my i5-3570k being used, so that's nice to see... but the GPU is pretty much immediately (within 1-2 minutes of being in-game) up to 55 C.  While this shouldn't be an issue... without Afterburner enabled, it didn't appear that the fans were starting even at 50-60 C.  Got a custom fan curve now installed... hoping that will help keep it down and the game running... but this EVGA 970 SC ACX 2.0 is really loud.

I was reading a review [here](http://www.adtech.com/show/8526/nvidia-geforce-gtx-980-review/5) and the last paragraph on the first section sounds like this won't be an issue but I honestly don't know enough about the tech to say for sure.

So basically I was wondering if anyone has some insight on the matter since my display setup will require utilizing one of the DPs as HDMI. I have 3 displays (2 LCD monitors and 1 50"" LED TV), one is DVI and the other 2 HDMI. The two displays are your regular extended desktop and the TV clones the primary monitor. So I'm just curious if I'll need to grab an active converter or if I can just use a regular DP to HDMI cable.

However, on most of the benchmarks I did see on 3DMark, there is about a 1000-1200 point difference between the 3-Way GTX 970 and the 2-Way GTX 980 with similar setups to what I have. Not really sure how that translates into real gaming.

I just upgraded from a GT 760 to a GTX 970 and I can't update or install any drivers. I have completely uninstalled all of the NVIDIA drivers from my computer because that's what the online tutorials told me to do and I can't download any now. I've tried going to the NVIDIA website and using the CD that came with the graphics card. My computer won't even recognize that I have the GTX 970 installed, despite the fact that I believe I installed it correctly and the HDMI cable is absolutely plugged into the graphics card itself.

I don't believe this to be a problem with the GTX 970 because I was having troubles updating my drivers before I even upgraded (It got so FUBAR that I had to do a clean install of windows 8.1). Everytime I try, the download starts, gets maybe 5-10% of the bar loaded, then I get the BSoD and the nvlddmkm.sys error.

Please help. I am absolutely freaking out right now and I don't know what to do. I can provide pictures of my installed GTX 970 if anyone seems to think that might be the problem.

EDIT: So I managed to install the drivers in safe mode and it totally crashed my computer. I have I installed the 64 bit version as I'm running 64 bit Windows 8.1. Could this be a problem where for some reason my computer just isn't compatible with this driver?

EDIT 2: To maybe help out some people help me out, here are the things I've tried. Reinstalling the old GPU to reinstall the drivers and then uninstall them again, didn't work. I tried using DDU to uninstall everything NVIDIA and then installing the new drivers, didn't work. I managed to get the drivers to install in safe mode but when I booted into regular mode it BSoD and gave me the nvlddmkm.sys error again. I'm currently trying to wipe my hard drive and reinstall Windows 8.1 to try again.

I can confirm that overheating was indeed not the issue.  But based on the BSOD logs it appears to be related to nVidia's driver, and that alone.  At that time no other games of mine were giving me issues; FIFA 15, Assetto Corsa (on triple screens), PVZ:GW, etc.

I contacted EVGA support (I have an EVGA GTX 970 SC 4GB ACX 2.0) and they recommended a clean re-install including using DDU.  I will admit I forgot to uninstall MSI Afterburner, but I did disable it from windows startup during this process.  The removal appeared to work just fine.  After reinstalling the drivers a reboot was required... but on reboot after the POST screen from my BIOS and selecting Windows 7 (my primary OS) from my boot menu (dual booted with Win 10 TP on a spare drive)... after windows tries to load (I see the Windows loading splash screen) I lose all signal to my monitors.  Have to go back to safe mode and uninstall to try again.

Tonight when I get home from work to try again... I will completely uninstall Afterburner and RivaTuner Server before attempting one more complete uninstall and reinstall of the drivers.

I tried restarting the laptop after each change in the nvidia control panel from integrated/dedicated, same thing. Set everything to 'performance' settings in the control panel, no change in performance at all.

In AC:U, at minimum settings, 1366x768, in the main menu I get around ~10 fps, the actual game barely reaches 5 fps.

Maybe the said benchmarks aren't exactly akin to reality, but, come on, there's quite the difference. 

It's a brand new laptop, so I don't think overheating from dust buildup or something is the problem, and the latest drivers are installed.

Disabling Intel HD in device manager and using a different monitor doesn't allow me to use the 850m.

Also, the nvidia gpu activity tray thing shows mafia 2 as using the nvidia gpu, both when I select integrated as preferred and HIGH-PERFORMANCE nvidia processor.

Now my problem is that im running games at 1366x768 due to that being my current monitor set up for the moment. I also have a second monitor at 1440x900 that i use for programs when I game. Now, could my FPS issues be because of having a second monitor? can they be CPU bound? I'm using a I5-4430 clocked at 3.0 GHZ but mostly runs at 3.2. Now keep in mind FC4 is the one with the problems at the moment. Bf4 full ultra never dips at 60 and i even put the resolution scale up too. and Metro Last light was 110?

nvidia,JocLayton,13,6,"GTX 970 driver restarting during games?So I bought a GTX 970 recently, and I've been using it to play games I previously couldn't run, like Dead Rising 3. But at certain times during games, my screen will go black and my GPU fan will stop, and eventually it'll go to my desktop with a ""display adapter kernel stopped responding and was restarted"" message or something similar to that. The temperature on my GPU monitor is never going above 60C, so I wouldn't imagine it was heat-related, unless the 970 is somehow considerably less heat-resistant than my 570 which was perfectly fine at 80-90C. Is this a normal problem with the 970?"

nvidia,[deleted],6,2,"46"" Seiki HDMI sizing as a 17"" displayI have an MSI GT72 with a GeForce GTX980M with Windows 8.1. Amazing laptop, good lord.

So, I'm sitting here trying to configure my 46"" 1080p 60Hz Seiki TV to be a second display, I've done this with a 1080p SVGA Cable in the past and never had a single problem, but I've never had to do this with an HDMI before.

&amp;nbsp;

First, the card handles it like it's a mirror; which is fine, I just switched it to extended desktop; this is where it got weird though.  I set the scaling on my TV to 1:1, so I have pixels lined up perfect, but I don't know how to get my Card to send the signal as a 46"" display, and not a monitor of the same size (17.3""). It basically looks like I took my 17.3"" 1080p display and just stretched it across a 46"" canvas. Looks terrible and like everything is zoomed in.

So, it's a little frustrating, and I can't seem to find my way around the nvidia control panel as well as I did the AMD/Radeon CP before I upgraded.. There's no way to change the size of the screen, only the resolution.. This probably would be less of a problem if I used a DP to HDMI converter and just sent the signal using one of my Mini-DP ports, but I don't really want to do that unless it's a last resort. I've tried google searching, but most things just come up about the 1:1 ratio, I have no idea what to look for;  Any suggestions?

I recently set a custom resolution for my BenQ VZ2350HM 23"" IPS monitor. I have confirmed no frames are being skipped through the ufo test site.

However, I am a bit sceptical for some of the other games and was wondering if there was a way to set the custom resolution so that every game uses it. I am running the custom resolution through HDMI because I need the audio signal to be carried to the monitor. 

Is there a utility I can use to force the refresh rate on all games. Maybe a setting on the control panel? How about if I use the EVGA Precision X program to set 'custom pixel clock'?

First, I am unable to play Battlefield 4 and Skyrim without the games crashing. I also have issues when watching a movie via VLC.

Second, every now and then both screens go black for 1-3 seconds and then come back on. Once they are back on, [this](http://i.imgur.com/kcQbB1W.png) error message pops up. Initially I thought it was a bad driver so i installed an older version (344.48), but the error still pops up.

Third, when i start up my computer, I get a ""no signal"" message from both monitors. Windows starts up fine, I can hear the start up music, but no signal to the monitors. I've tried changing the cables, the connections, everything. The only way I'm able to get a signal is by unplugging the computer for about a minute and then booting up.

Now, can all of this be due to getting the second monitor, and my settings aren't correct, thus causing strain on my video card? Or are these symptoms of a dying card? I purchased all the hardware 3 years ago, so it's hard for me to think that some of the parts are starting to die.

nvidia,SoberIrishGuy,19,6,"SLI 970 benchmarks worse than single cardI finally got around to installing my second 970 today, and having just benchmarked with one card, I thought I would try out my new SLI setup. I was quite surprised to find that the SLI'd cards were scoring lower than the single card, as you can see [here](http://imgur.com/a/q4mY9). From what I can see, the 970 SLI should be quite a lot higher.


Both cards show 100% utilization when Heaven is running. I've tried re-seating the cards and the SLI bridge and updating the drivers. My BIOS is also up to date. I've Googled around and there seems to be an SLI issue where one 9xx card will have a lower voltage than the other, but according to GPU-Z both my cards are pretty close to one another. My specs are as follows:


- NVIDIA Geforce GTX 970 x2
- Intel i7 3770K
- Gigabyte Z68X-UD3H-B3 motherboard
- 8 GB DDR3 RAM
- Samsung 830 SSD
- 1300W EVGA Supernova G2 PSU
- 1920x1080 display connected via Displayport to DVI x3
- NZXT Phantom 820 case with a lot of fans
- Windows 8.1 64 bit, freshly installed a week ago

Seeing that I paid 500 dollars for the card, and also seeing that the 780 Ti went lower than what I paid, I would either like to go for a 780 Ti or a 980. The question is, how would I do this? The step up program by EVGA would force me to have to pay the difference that the 980 costs, which is around 50 dollars. I'm thinking if I can sell my 780 somehow, maybe I can exchange for a 780 Ti. Right now I think I was just screwed out of a lot of money. Anyone have any advice as to what I can do?"

Ideally, I'm going to have 5 monitors, a 4k large, main monitor to run Visual Studio, Photoshop and some other things, then I want my 4 side monitors (2 on each side, vertical) to have my email, web browser, Spotify, etc.

What's the best way to do this?  I was thinking an NVS card could drive the 4 smaller monitors, and use a GeForce card's 2 outputs to drive the 4k display.

I know I could use SLI to get two GeForce cards working together, but the power/thermal requirements for a GeForce card is &gt; 100W, vs. 45W for the NVS card.  I'm trying to keep the PC as cool and quiet as reasonably possible.

I'm thinking a GeForce GTX 970 (145W) along with an NVS 510 (45W).

Then, once I get the power button to respond again, the computer starts up, displays what I perceive to be the GPU gigabyte bios screen for a brief few seconds, and then the whole PC just shuts down again and reboots, repeating this a few times until the system finally randomly boots all the way up.

After this entire cycle, I am actually able to login and play games with zero issues. Games run great so far, benchmark results seem consistent with others, and no issues until I either put the computer to sleep (100% error follow this so far) or restart the PC (I'd say 50% error when restarting without sleep).

I feel that this may be displayport related. I even read something about a displayport cable that has power running both ways through the 20th pin (or something like that) might be the culprit? I could have totally read that the wrong way. I am just hoping someone here might be able to deliver some insight in this. I have not tested this with any other output to the monitor yet (DVI/HDMI), but I will probably do that tonight. In the meantime, if you have some advice, or better yet, know of this issue, please let me know.

Also, it would be great if a gtx 980 owner stepped in and verified that they do NOT have any issues using DisplayPort with a similar setup to mine, or the ones in the thread I linked.

The reason for my title is this thread here: https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/777412/geforce-drivers/black-screen-on-windows-login-344-16-and-11-on-displayport-with-gtx980-sc/1/

I had a scary experience with trojans my PC, and the only source I can think where they came from is from GeForce Experience.

Yesterday I noticed GFE had a notification of a new driver. I usually update drivers manually, but decided to try the GFE update. The update failed without any notification, but I was busy doing something else on my PC and just dismissed it. I also tried the optimization on one of the games (never really tried it before). I left home and turned off my PC bit later.

Then later that evening I came back home and turned my PC back on. Few minutes after booting I was browsing internet, and Windows 7 Aero turned itself off, and graphics card fan throttled up. It was weird because I wasn't doing anything that would use graphics card too heavily. I opened task manager, and there was three processes that were clearly some sort of trojan/malware/whatever, one labeled keylogger. I immediately pulled the plug on my router, and deleted the GFE and Nvidia drivers (didn't take a screenshot or write the names of the processes down unfortunately). I didn't have a proper antivirus at the moment either, only MS Security Essentials. 

I reinstalled Nvidia drivers without GFE, and also installed a proper antivirus now, checked my PC but didn't find any more malware. 

Is it possible that the malware actually came from GFE? I didn't do any other changes on my PC before this happened, didn't visit any weird sites or download anything else. If it actually came from GFE, how is this possible? Should I do something else to protect my PC?"

nvidia,[deleted],0,1,"[Q] A few questions as can't decide :/ (780ti/970/980/?)Really can't decide what to buy at the moment. Got a few choices and just wondered what would be best direction to go.

Currently have SLI GTX 570s so it's about time to get some new ones. Live in the UK so doing prices as £. Play games such as GW2, ESO and CSGO so not very big games though ESO is kinda a hog but that's due to processing power I think not gpu. I have bought Shadow of Mordor and my 570s run it like a potatoe, so why I'm looking at a new card.

1. Wait for next series. (Read stuff that said it wasn't such a power leap with the 9 series so maybe should wait till next for the bigger leap though maybe can just SLI one of the others? I tend to buy a graphics card and use it for minimum a year and a half to 2 years).

2. Get a 780ti as seems close to the 980. (It is cheaper by about £120, though downside is the higher power, 1gb less of vram as well as losing support quicker)

3. Get gigabyte gtx 970 g1 as seems good overclocked and close to the 980. (I never know about the makes and what to choose like MSI vs EVGA vs Zotac vs Gigabyte.... does it really matter?)

4. Get the gtx980 version (not sure how much better this is over the 970... most reviews only give a few fps it seems) 

Put my sort of question would like answered or my points in the brackets.

For me my vest option is the 970 I think. Saving nearly £200 going for the 970 and maybe in a few months I can get another and SLI them is my best option. £500 is quite a big steep and could have to wait till next month till I can buy that when I can buy the 970 now.

--

I have two video cards installed in my system to allow the usage of three monitors. This setup is a few years old where the card I purchased (GTX 550 Ti) only supported two monitors and I needed a second card (GTX 210).

GeForce Experience told me that I had a driver update available so I tried to install it. When the installation of the driver version 344.11 started, my PC immediately locked up and after a moment, rebooted. When Windows was starting up, the PC rebooted again, and this happened indefinitely.

To make a long story short, the issue I had was that the driver did not detect my GTX 210 which is no longer supported by drivers 343+. Both GeForce Experience and the direct download of the driver decided my PC was compatible with the new driver since I can only assume it saw my GTX 550 Ti and didn't dig too much deeper.

This issue was easily resolved by booting into Safe Mode and reverting to the 340.52 driver--the last driver to support the GTX 200 series.

The Bug
-----------
The driver compatibility check needs to be more thorough and find the lowest common denominator in the hardware list to ensure true system compatibility, otherwise the driver will crash Windows indefinitely."

SLI enabled for the middle monitor (2560x1080) when playing games, while the side monitors (1920x1080) display the desktop or what-have-you.

nVidia Surround doesn't seem to be a solution because it doesn't recognize my UltraWide monitor's resolution and treats it as a 1920x1080 screen (5760x1080 instead of 6400x1080).

nvidia,[deleted],0,1,"Underclocking stops ""Driver has stopped working and has recovered"". What does this mean?Hi there! When I built my computer about a year and a half ago I put in a GTX 660 OC from Gigabyte. The card worked great for awhile until I started getting random ""Display Driver has stopped working..."" errors. They were EXTREMELY random. They would happen at different parts of games, browsing with firefox or just on skype with people. Even worse they were almost impossible to replicate. With some driver's the problem would be worse and sometimes it wouldn't happen at all. It was all very strange. I dealt with this problem for about this whole past year. I read so many different forums on what to do. Went through all my NVIDIA settings to make sure they were right, changed the Tdrdelay, checked my CPU, put in new RAM after I found out one stick was actually bad(This I really thought was the culprit), did clean installs of the drivers and updated my BIOS. Nothing worked. Then finally, I read on the nvidia forums to download MSI Afterburner and turn down the Core and Memory clock down by about 100. This fixed the problem entirely. I haven't had a display problem in 2 months. 


So I was just wondering. What does this mean? I asked a few friends and they said it could be my MOBO, PSU or GPU. If it was my PSU or MOBO I think I would be getting the error even with the card at the new clock speed. I have never had any other issue with the computer other than this and the blue screen from bad memory. I believe the card is just on it's last legs and unstable at the manufacture's overclock.

I have adjusted to fan profile so that the card idles at 37-40 degrees at 50% fan speed. With the updated fan curve it doesn't reach over 67 degrees while gaming. What could have caused this sudden increase in temps? Is it time to send the card back to Nvidia to see if I can get it replaced? Should I apply new thermal paste? I'm just at a loss as to how this could have happened so suddenly.

So I recently purchased a MSI GTX980. I used to have a GTX580. The problem I am encountering is that the GTX980 caps out at a 100% GPU use and crashes when running two seperate things. Fx, watching a youtube video on one screen (A samsung TV connected via HDMI) and playing Warthunder on the other. This was never a problem with my previous graphics card (GTX 580) and only started on the new one. The only way I have found to fix it is to run the 'MSI game app' which automatically overclock's the graphics card and thereby avoiding hitting the ceiling. 

Anyone having this same issue? I don't know if its my card that's broken or if its standard that you have to run the gaming app for it to work.

Wow. Wtf. There was something within that driver that suddenly unlocked the true potential of my graphics card.

Now, in every game at 1920x1080, it is buttery smooth.

this will be a lengthy post about me whining (/r/firstworldproblems). Be prepared.

Over a week ago, i purchased the Nvidia Shield Tablet, including cover, from [here](http://shield.nvidia.com/buy-now/).
When i saw this beautiful 8 inch tablet with front facing speakers and stylus, and the price tag of 299$, i threw my money at the computer and screamed GIVE ME, TAKE MY MONEY.

I was soooo excited when i saw the big ""**BUY NOW**"" button. After adding everything to the cart, and checking out, i noticed it said ""Please allow two weeks for delivery"". Fair enough, shipping things takes time, and that is not in their control. All in all, 450 Canadian Dollars, i paid through paypal and off we went.

It did not take long for the invoice to arrive, [confirming my order had been received](http://imgur.com/ugUk6qw). It also said there will be a separate E-Mail when my order has been shipped. Fairly standard procedure.

Now here we are, eight days later. I still don't see my shipment confirmation or tracking number. So i contact their support with a friendly ""Ay mate, what's happening with that order?"". I get this reply, and i quote:

&gt; We apologize for the inconvenience; unfortunately the product that you
ordered is currently out of stock. Although we do not have an estimated
arrival date, we are working to obtain more stock as soon as possible.

&gt; As soon as we receive your product, your order will be promptly shipped
and you will be notified via email. Rest assured that we will not charge
your card until the product ships. Your patience is greatly appreciated.


U fookin wot m8? How can that be? Nowhere, on the store website, do you have any indication that the item is not available! What do you mean YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN THERE WILL BE MORE?

**BECAUSE I TELL YOU FOR A FACT THAT IF I KNEW THE ITEM WAS TEMPORARILY OUT OF STOCK, I WOULD HAVE WAITED WITH MY PURCHASE**

And no, this is not me being an impatient little twat. This is straight up bullshit of the first degree! How can you sell items online, with a big **BUY NOW** button, and lead the customer to believe that the product he's buying is available NOW? This is the worst crime an online store can commit! Telling you they have something for sale, take your money, then let you wait and wait and wait, until i finally get tired of waiting, and then saying ""Opps, out of stock, sorry.""

**This could have been entirely avoided by showing that the item is temporarily out of stock, before you make the purchase**.
I am not going to stand for this kind of practice, because it's scummy at the best. 

I have contacted their customer service and expressed my dismay at the situation, and asked if i can straight up have my money back if the item has not been shipped within two weeks, as it's indicated on the invoice. 

What do you guys think about this here? Should this be an acceptable thing to do, or am i justified for being upset here?

Here is my response, expressing my discontempt in a civil manner!

&gt;Hello,

&gt;This is not good. At all. Would I have known from your on-line store, that the product was indeed out of stock, I would have purchased it through another retailer that still had a quantity on hand, or waited all together.

&gt;In regards to saying I will not be charged until the product ships, I have been charged by Nvidia through PayPal. 

&gt;There is no indication in your on-line store that the product is not in Stock except for the vague phrase ""allow for up to two weeks of delivery"" which I assume means delivered to my door.

&gt;So I yet cling on to hope that by September 14,  the product will be delivered.

&gt;I did consider opting to purchase the controller at a later time instead of bundling it together all at once. But how am I supposed to trust your on-line merchant services when there is no transparency regarding item availability. ""we don't know"" is something I never want to hear when someone has already taken my money.

&gt;Please let me know what my options are regarding cancelling the order and getting my money back if the item has not shipped by the 14th of September.

&gt;It's all done now, after the fact there is nothing much to do except wait with a slightly sour taste in the mouth. All could have been avoided solely by displaying a ""Temporarily out of stock"" text before you click on the ""BUY NOW"" button.

&gt;Regards,

If you go to their [online store website](http://shield.nvidia.com/buy-now/) you still don't get any indication that the product is not in stock! I will keep this updated as our correspondence continues. "

Been playing games on my rig for about 8 months now with no issues. I was able to play almost all my games on the highest settings on 1920 x 1080. Suddenly today after playing Kings Bounty Warriors of the North I went onto The Incredible Adventures of Vanhelsing and noticed the game was quite laggy. Then moved onto Payday 2 to also notice the gameplay was also laggy.

Giving the PC a restart I jumped onto Vanhelsing again and then Bioshock Infinite to notice very choppy gameplay where there was none at all before. I gave the driver a reinstall and PC a restart to still find this choppy gameplay. I haven't installed anything to my knowledge in the day (was working fine yesterday) that would effect gameplay like this. Playing with the settings of Van Helsing seemed to get it working on medium with what seems not many issues. But all my other games still struggle where they never had issues before. I also gave Skyrim a try which was also slow and choppy. A game that originally worked completely fine at ultra.

Here's my rig for reference: http://i.imgur.com/qWmvqUX.png [1]

Doing a test with MSI Afterburner shows there appears to be nothing in the background to my knowledge which is causing the issue as it seems to be low and steady when out of the game. CPU usage doesn't go above about 50% or much at all with most of my cores but sometimes go higher. And my temps seem to be good as well.

Here is the gpu usage when going in and out of Skyrim:

http://i.imgur.com/9JhKiIb.png [2]

Looking at it though it shows that my power % is currently 630%ish. When I checked my friends PC his is only 50%. This causes some concern as this seems to be completely wrong.

As I mentioned previously the games worked fine previously. And is not just one or two games but all my higher powered games. It's almost as some sort of cap has suddenly been introduced which is limiting how powerful they can be. Though my GPU is working at 100%.

Any help is much loved.

Yesterday I had to format the hard drive. When I reinstalled the drivers and everything else, I tried to add the downsampled resolution, but during the test everything looks very blurry, which never happened before (I'm using the same monitor), so I decided not to save the resolution.

Any tips?Thanks!"

nvidia,lleti,10,15,"GTX970 leaks shows a 256b memory bus as opposed to the assumed 192b; what're the chances of a 384b bus on the GTX980?So, I recently splashed out on a 4K monitor - which was a relatively large mistake, as my SLi'd 680s are screaming in their attempts to run a lot of games at that resolution. In particular, detail-heavy games such as Civ5 are having problems in loading textures.

I've been sitting here, staring at the bank-balance draining Titan Z, slightly sweating over the 768-bit memory bus (albeit it's shared between 2 GPU's); knowing it will solve all my 4K/Gaming problems, but also being fully aware that I will be living off baked beans, and living in a cardboard box for a couple of months following that purchase.

I've been sitting tight for the 980's release (and saved all summer to afford an SLI'd pair if they fall in around the €600 bracket); but my main worry is seeing another 256bit memory bus. Albeit from looking over the Maxwell arch, it'll be FAR more memory efficient, I still feel as though 256bit is just not enough for any card to handle 4K Gaming with detailed assets. The 780ti again, looks excellent - but pending the 980's performance (or a 980ti release), I'd feel an idiot if I splashed out my savings on a card that has a big brother show up within a matter of weeks.

So, /r/nvidia (also, awesome subreddit you guys have here); do you think there's any hopes of us seeing a 384-bit memory bus on the 980, or do you think we'll be waiting for a 980ti/980 8GB edition before a memory bus of that size will appear for us under the maxwell range?

 This happened ever since I replaced a now dead 8600GT with a temporary 9600GT, I updated the drivers to try and get a game to stop crashing, and since then i've been driven mad by it all.

Windows was reinstalled once this happened, and it still didn't fix the issue, i'm reinstalling again to be doubly sure. PC was cleaned internally and problems still persist.

The 8600gt played everything fine before it died on me, and the thing is I don't recall ever downloading a driver for it, it was probably a default version and it let me play everything fine: WoW, Warcraft 3, Street Fighter 4 etc.

 Would trial and error through old drivers be worth a  shot before reinstall? Where is a reliable/safe resource to find them for the card?

But which card/cards? I game at 4k, so vram is nice. So 780Ti isn't so useful (3gb is too low), and 780Ti SLI is right out of the question (since SLI puts more memory pressure on the cards).

Then there's the new cards coming out now. I've reserved a 980 at my local PC parts shop, but I don't know if that's really a decent choice. I've heard it's not going to be as fast as even a SINGLE 780Ti (!!!) but no reviews are out yet. Since it's new it's going to cost a tonne, too, especially here in Aus (looking at 1000AUD, or 900USD - fucking Australia tax) - which means maybe two cheaper cards are better?

* Also are there steps like 1.5 x ? as in 3840x1620 (x1.5 in my case) or just 5120x2160 (x2 from 2560x1080).

but now my problem. The price. In the US the price is 199$ w/o shipping. if you look at the prices in europe the price is at Amazon UK £186.00(312.81$) , Amazon FR EUR 289,95(389.44$) and at Amazon DE it is EUR 361,50(485.54$) for amazon FR and DE Thats almost 2 times the price in the US.

also have not found a USA shop to ship to europe.

why is the price so different from the us? "

EDIT: I was able to fix the issue by uninstalling GeForce Experience and Nvidia drivers and installing them separately. "
nvidia,MinisterPhobia,1,2,"Unable to Install ANY Nvidia Product Using the Nvidia Installers; Get Error: ""The directory name is invalid.""I'm having a problem whereby neither the GeForce Experience, nor any of the stand-alone driver installers, will run. They get through their decompression progress without any issues, and then when the actual installer starts, I get a popup window with an error that reads, ""The directory name is invalid.""

Currently, I am receiving driver updates via Windows Update exclusively, which is not something that I like to admit to.

I'm not certain how long this has been going on for, but, my previous update before I noticed this all happening a couple of weeks ago was back in May of this year (2014).

After talking to some friends and having no luck in coming up with an idea on how to fix this, I submitted a ticket with Nvidia support. I'll detail what I've done with them below. After getting the run around with their Level 1 agents who really didn't have a clue, I demanded to be escalated to Level 2, where I have been working with a great guy who has been in contact with the Driver Devs and we've largely run out of ideas.

So, before I go so far as to reinstall the OS, I figured that I should ask you guys what you think the issue might be and see if there's any suggestions. I will be x-posting this to both /r/nvidia and /r/techsupport in the hopes of getting a decent response.

First, about my computer. The hardware that I'm currently using can be found here: http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/user/ministerphobia/saved/8ssKHx

A quick summary of the most important parts:

* Windows 7, x64, Professional
* Intel i5 3570-k
* 32gb of RAM
* 2x EVGA GTX570 running in SLI

So, on to what I did to try and fix this issue.

1. First steps were the obvious ideas. Anit-virus, Anti-malware scans. I decompressed the installers and ran the setup.exe files directly. I tried running the installers from within the c:\Program Files\ directory. I removed the C:\NVIDIA directory, and wiped everything out of any TEMP directory that I was aware of.

2. On the suggestion of a friend who I used to work with in Tech Support, and he's gone on to do Tech Support with Mission Critical equipement, I downloaded and ran a program called CCleaner. I normally avoid programs like this, but, I figured the issue couldn't get any worse.

3. Safemode with Networking.

4. New Windows User Account. I don't actually know what this ever solves, and it's not the first time that I've been asked to do it. In this case, however, nothing was solved.

5. A full removal tool has been suggested. Specifically, the one located here: https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/550192/?comment=4185513 I haven't done this yet and that is my next step if there are no other ideas.

6. Disabling UAC was suggested. I run without UAC running at all. Since I am the only user on this system, and I trust myself (shutup!), I don't see the value in it.

7. This was suggested: http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3171 and the files generated were provided to the Level 2 Tech, who also shared them with his Dev colleagues. This yielded no errors.

8. I shorcut was made to the installer and it was given the silent install option, ""GeForce_Experience_v2.1.1.0.exe -s""

9. I was asked tun run ""sfc /scannow"" from the command line, and it found no errors.

10. I rebooted into Repair Mode, ran the OS Repair tool and the Memory Checker tool. Neither found any issues, and upon booting back into windows, the issue persists.

Right now, I'm looking for suggestions on ANYTHING else to try before I do a full OS reinstall.

This issues is ONLY effecting the Nvidia installers and I've had no issues with any other installers.

I've asked the tech for a FULL list of all addidions/alterations that ANY Nvidia product will have made to my computer so that I can remove ALL of them, reboot, and then try to run the program again, but, that will be the absolute final step before an OS reinstall is decided upon.

So, any ideas or suggestions that can be provided would be greatly appreciated. I've been unable to figure out what directory the installers are trying to access that they're reading as invalid, so, that could be a further idea to explore.

Thank you, in advance, for any help.

Fast forward to today, and certain games (guns of icarus, CS:Source, ""unrissen"") ""flicker"" when in fullscreen mode.  This goes away only under one of two conditions.  The first, being to play the game in ""Windowed"" mode.  The second being to turn off vsync entirely for the game (from within nvidia ""Program Settings"").

nvidia,[deleted],11,7,"Nvidia display driver crash...at the end of my ropeHi all,
So I thought I'd see if anyone has encountered this problem, in advance sorry for any grammatical mistakes, I am on my phone. 

For at least the last 2 years I have been having spurious failures of my nvidia display drivers. Blank for a couple of seconds while gaming and occasionally whilst watching full screen HD streams.  Once it goes blank one of two things happen. 
1. The screen goes blank it comes back and will be good for a few seconds followed by multiple failures and then eventually a BSoD. I van eliminate the blue screen by closing whatever game I am playing. If this happens when the computer restarts sometimes USB devices will play up, mouse/keyboard.  

2. Single failure followed by no follow ups and no issues until the next time it happens this can be hrs or days. 

Things I have tested/tried; I brought the computer to my mate in IT and he had a look at it and could find NO issues. He did graphics stresses with benchmark. Ran memtest, RAM is fine.  He found nothing wrong with the card and suggested it could be a power issue (no one else living with me has this issue when using same power ports etc). Upon getting it back from my mate I bought a new power board and the issue didn't arise again for a number of months when it came back. 

This time I thought ok it's clearly a power issue maybe the PSU is fucked so I bought a new one mine being a 2nd hand one ( mate got a new one on warranty for a missing screw lol). The new PSU didn't help.

At this stage I thought ok maybe it's an issue with my installs. I'll format. So seeing as I had an old 320gb seagate (9 years) ill get an ssd and go for it. The format did not work. 

This is where I am at and I'm just about ready to scrap the thing and buy a Mac (not really). I'm heading overseas in 6 months and am not really that interested in buying more pieces/new computer to solve the issue as when I last looked to get a new mobo/CPU/Ram for gaming is approx AUD$600. Any help is greatly appreciated. has anyone else encountered this?

I have the latest drivers etc and this can happen with old games like cs1.6, hearthstone or graphic intensive games like crisis/metro last light. The game doesn't seem to matter :(

nvidia,dbkjones,3,3,"Black Screen on Game Start or Resolution ChangeSo, here's an interesting problem I've hit today. Did a brand new build of a pc with a GTX 760, and plugged it all into my old HannsG 28"" and FujiPlus 19"" monitors. Everything worked great until I tried starting a game for the first time. The 28"", connected via HDMI as my main monitor, went black and stayed that way. The game started in the background no problem, I could hear the sound, but the monitor stayed black. My 19' second monitor was fine. Alt-Tab did nothing, and neither did closing the game. Only restarting the computer, or unplugging the monitor for 30 seconds gets it to display anything again. When I do this, everything seems fine. 

The monitor works fine connected to other computers. And games that do not change the resolution at start up do not trigger this (however, if the cycle the resolution on closing, it happens). So I'm thinking it has something to do with how the resolution is changed, or perhaps how the refresh rate is affected (the 28"" is at 59hz in some utilities, 60hz in others). DXDiag sees no issues. BIOS and Geforce drivers are all at the latest. No idea what else could be the issue.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

An update 8/13/14: I spoke with EVGA customer support, and they recommended a full driver uninstall/reinstall refresh. I did this, and now the monitor doesn't work at all. But I did keep playing with it. I had been connecting to the 760 via HDMI and HDMI/DVI, all with the same port on the monitor end. I had tested my laptop using VGA though. So I tried the VGA port to the 760 using a DVI adapter, and it works flawlessly. So either my card is having problems reading anything via HDMI (even using HDMI-DVI cord it registered in the Control Panel as an HDMI connection) or the HDMI port on my monitor has died. I'm going to do a few more tests tonight to see if I can narrow down the problem further."

I tried every possible driver version possible, clean instal and everything. I even got specialized tools to make sure nothing was left of the old drivers just in case. Nothing worked and it didnt even reduce the frequency of failures.

In my desperation i even as far as doing factory of the pc and its changed nothing.

After the reset and countless installation, it cannot possibly be a driver issue,  i made sure its wasn't an overheating problem and I did multiple ram test, the result point toward it not being the source.

So what now? do i buy a new card? do i scrap the entire thing?

nvidia,VoidRaizer,2,7,"How do I solve this bizarre monitor issue?I have 3 displays from a GTX 780 card.  I've got 2 DVI's which work as expected but my 3rd connection won't cooperate.  I have my 3rd monitor hooked in via HDMI cable, and my card is determined to make that monitor into an HDTV.

As you would expect, the monitor looks crappy - dimmed, blurry, washed out - while it's being told by my card that it's a TV and not a monitor.  Now, under the NVIDIA Control Panel, under Display, there is an option called ""Change Resolution""

Under this option, there's a section that allows you to select which monitor to modify, and it tells you the connection type.  ""Connector: HDMI - HDTV"" - (here's problem 1, idk why it says HDMI - HDTV instead of just HDMI and there's no way to change it in these menus)

Beyond that, the first resolution section say ""Ultra HD, HD, SD"" and it lists a bunch, and then another section that says ""PC"" and has options like 1920x1080 etc..

The problem is that under the Ultra HD section, the first option says ""1080p, 1920x1080 (native)"" and it looks terrible. This is the TV section.  I have to go down to the PC section and select 1920x1080 and apply and tada, problem solved.

However, whenever I sleep/turnoff/screensaver becomes active/blink, the monitor resets to its native TV resolution.

How do I make the PC resolution its native resolution, or how do I make it just stop going to TV?"

Please help, Obi Wan!System specs: 1) Windows 7 Home Edition 2) AMD 1100T Thuban Black Edition hexacore CPU @ 3.3ghz 3) PNY GTX 770 4gb 4) 7 gigs of ram ( I know it's weird but it's salvaged from an old system and ramtests have shown it's not the issue, nor is ram usage) 5) Asrock 890GX Pro3 Mobo 6) 750W gold rated Corsair modular power supply

Effectively, I've been experiencing stuttering and framedrops the likes of which I've never seen. It's making DoTA 2 and various other games absolutely unplayable - I haven't found a game that doesn't experience this issue. Attached is a Shadowplay video of Splinter Cell: Blacklist in high settings ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJjV9Y6xXcI&amp;feature=youtu.be ). Stutters do not usually happen immediately, and take 1-3 minutes to set in. Temperatures during stutters never go over 65 degrees and 50 degrees on the CPU and graphics card, respectively. I also do not notice a spike in CPU usage; CPU usage hovers around 43% or so during DoTA 2 matches and GPU usage hovers around 50-60%.
Attempted fixes so far: 1) Unparked my cores. 2) Page file moved to relatively unused partition and changed to 14500mb min/max. 3) Clean driver installations with DDU. 4) Muted headset and speaker sound to test whether it was sound related. 5) Tried steam and uplay simultaneously in offline mode. 6) Cried manly tears and prayed to every deity.

nvidia,DBuxtehude,9,8,"My 560Ti is artifacting. Will a 750Ti hold me over until the 870 comes out?I have an Asus GTX 560Ti in my Micro-ATX gaming rig. It's lived a hard life; I've used it as a testbed for a water block and a few aftermarket coolers, and it's currently back with it's stock cooler and running at stock clocks.

Recently, it's started artifacting when I've been gaming for more than an hour or so. I ran MemtestG80 and the VRAM seems to check out, so I'm guessing the GPU is finally starting to give up the ghost. I re-TIMed the heatsink, but that didn't seem to help much.

I have been pretty satisfied with the performance of the 560Ti. I game at 1920x1200, and even though I can't run max settings on newer games anymore, I haven't really been hankering for an upgrade.

Since my next monitor will likely be 1440p, I'd like to ultimately end up with a moderately powerful card. At the same time, since I'm running in a micro-ATX case, I'd like to keep the heat down if possible. The upcoming Maxwell GPUs sound promising, the 860 or 870 in particular.

So my question is, if I'm not able to limp my trusty 560Ti along until the GTX 800 series launches, would a 750Ti be a decent card to hold me over until then?

Perhaps I could use the 750Ti as a dedicated PhysX card once the 800 series comes out?"

nvidia,Jack_BE,4,1,"Experiences with nVidia Surround in combination with SLIHey guys. Small question, I'm a big multimonitor fan (using an AMD Eyefinity with 3x Full HD monitors now). I've always been an nVidia fan, but AMD was first with the whole ""combine 3 monitors into 1"" thing and had good support for it at first, so I landed on AMD when I started.

At the end of the year I'm planning on building a new Haswell-E based system with 2 brand new GPUs (need a ton of power to render that large of a surface, it's pretty much 3/4ths of a 4k monitor). Preferrably that would be a double GTX 880 or something like that.

But now my question: how well and how stable does nVidia surround work when combined with SLI? I've searched around on the internet and found that both AMD and nVidia have issues when combining multigpu with multimonitor, and sadly nVidia tends to come out as ""even a bit worse than AMD"" on that part. Which is a pitty because nVidia is normally notorious for stable drivers.

Your experiences?"
nvidia,[deleted],8,2,"Asus GTX 780 stutterHi, I have a ASUS GTX 780 DirectCU II OC with some issues. 

I have my main samsung (1080p@60hz) monitor connected with DVI-&gt;HDMI cable and I want to plug in my Samsung TV (1080p@60hz) HDMI-&gt;HDMI, but as soon as I plug in the cable, even with the TV turned off and ""Show only desktop on 1"" (my monitor) my entire computer stutters about every second. A very short but noticeable stutter. 

Note: This happens in both Linux and Windows, so it does not seem to be OS specific.

Running www.testufo.com will not give me 60fps, but about 58-59 saying sync can't be achieved.

If I unplug the TV, sync goes back to normal. No stutter.

Other specs: Intel i7 2600k OC'ed to 4.4GHz, 8GB RAM, lots of free harddrive space etc.

However, no matter what I try I can't get my Acer to use my nVidia for any of my games, instead opting for the IGPU. I've tried using the Control Panel, but every time I close it out it seems to reset my settings, and using the launch with processor from my context menu also doesn't seem to use the card even when selected. I've tried this with and without Geforce experience installed. Even disabling the Integrated Graphics in the device manager works to no avail, and my BIOS doesn't seem to present me with the ability to switch/disable my GPU. I've also of course made sure the laptop recognizes the card.


Finally, after uninstalling the sold with driver and attempting to install a driver directly from nVidia the driver software did not install claiming no useable software found even after their site correctly identified my graphics card. (This forced me to run a backup to the old driver software.) Please this is incredibly frustrating, and for the life of me I can't figure out what to do, besides forcing a factory reset and starting from scratch. Anyways thanks for help in advance and I appreciate and advice!

nvidia,partyboy690,1,2,"[Help] Blue or black screen after login, doesn't happen on integrated chipHi All, I noticed this behaviour this morning before work which has puzzled me.

Last night I played a few hours of Counter Strike no problem, card wasn't overheating and everything was fine and this morning when I booted my computer it would allow me to login but as soon as I did the screen would go black or blue(not BSOD but just blue) I thought it may be my CPU overclock which I have found to be stable but I reset it to default and it happened again. I tried it a few more times and it kept happening.

I then switched to the integrated card using VGA booted and it worked perfectly, none of this weirdness. Does anyone know of any issues with any drivers? I've been on the latest WHQL drivers for a long time now with no issues and I changed absolutely nothing about my computer since last night so it's definitely not a software or hardware change.

nvidia,raipeh,8,3,"GTX 660 Display Driver Stopped RespondingMy GPU keeps crashing during gameplay. My PC is more than enough capable of handling the games I play, such as Counter-Strike GO, so that should not be the problem. Sometimes the driver straight out crashes and doesn't reload, but usually it comes back up, but still crashes the game, or makes my FPS go down severely.

Things I've tried:

- different drivers (older ones tend to work better, less crashes, but still happens daily)
- TDR registry editing
- overclocking on / off
- nVidia Control Panel settings
- Windows Power Management settings
- MSI Afterburner / EVGA Precision on / off
- Different graphical settings &amp; resolutions in games

And I'm sure there's even some more that I just can't remember from the top of my head right now, have yet to sacrifice little children or goats, though.

GPU is from MSI, and I'm currently using 306.97 drivers from MSI webpage. 

Temperatures are normal, not just in GPU but in the whole system. The GPU just straight out crashes, with no hints about why, or when it is going to happen.

I'm really bummed with this, scrounged all around the interwebs for answer, and it's yet to be found. Could it be (somehow) audio related, though? I've noticed some of the crashes happening in-game (CSGO for example) when something sudden happens, such as weapon firing, or a flash / smoke going off, I hear the initial sound, and then screen freezes or goes black, because the driver crashed.

I've run games like Arma 3/The Forest/GTA IV and any other game that is demanding on ultra settings without a problem (40 FPS + average).

The thing with DayZ standalone is, whenever I start it up, it looks like its running on an intel graphics card. I have major lag, can barely move my mouse and cant do anything.

My laptop came with an integrated gpu on the processor along with the dedicated nvidia geforce gtx 880m 8gb. It automatically switches between both when required, the thing is, I set DayZ to run using the 880m graphics card by default and I'm still having problems. I know my laptop is way more than capable enough of running DayZ, but I can't seem to get it. 

If anyone has any previous history with this issue or is experienced with the nvidia optimus technology my laptop is using, your help would greatly be appreciated.

Disclaimer: I currently own AMD equipment and no Nvidia equipment.

The Shadowplay function is a brilliant technology. Nvidia deserve to be praised for this. What upsets me though is how AMD now has an identical feature (Game DVR), released several months later. I can't shake the feeling that AMD ""stole"" the Nvidia tech and made it work on their devices. So now they have a similar tech without actually having to pay for researching it. 

While I may be totally wrong about this theory, and that these two functions may be two totally different technologies, I want to encourage people to reward companies that innovate. If you know someone that's planning on buying a card and who also wants to record, remind them of which company that actually developed and innovated with the recording system. "

Firstly I'll list my system specs:

-  i5 4690k overclocked to 4.6ghz @ 1.170v (got lucky in silicon lottery as it's insanely low voltage).

-  MSI Z97 AC Mate Motherboard (mini itx)

-  Samsung EVO 840 SSD 120gb

-  Western Digital Blue Cavier 1TB HDD

-  MSI Dragon Closed Loop CPU Cooler

-  MSI R9 270x (current GPU)

-  EVGA 500w Bronze 80+ PSU

-  Corsair Obsidian 250D Case

-  NZXT Sentry 2 Fan Controller

-  4 x Case Fans


So yer, anyone with my PSU or similar running a 770gtx without an issue? I've looked on various sites and the maximum power draw for systems seems to be around 380-400w. Obviously I know Nvidia recommend a 600w PSU but they like to cover their bases for people with cheap power supplies, as does everyone. Any feedback would be great, thanks.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses, I'm from the UK so only just woken up and read them. I guess now it's between buying a 770 + PSU or waiting it out with my current card and see what maxwell brings, maybe they will bring a decent upgrade for me with a 500w requirement... the 750ti is pretty impressive."

nvidia,DementedMedic,0,3,"A problem I have with shadowplay.I love shadowplay and find it so much better to use than Fraps, which I now only use for minecraft; however, I get a problem that after I have finished recording and I go to look at my files, some of the segments are much longer than they should be. This first happened with Bioshock: Infinite and both times I tried to record the first hour the footage was broken and the video segment that was supposed to be 15 mins was now an hour. When I go to play the file it will get to about a minute in and just stop, causing the player to crash. When I tried to convert the file, it crashes my converter. 

I managed to find a sort of temporary solution in, stop-starting my recording every 15 mins which seems to stop it, but makes it annoying to overlap my voice when editing, because of audio syncing.

This was only happening on Bioshock so I assumes it was a Bioshock problem, but then when I went to record Far Cry 2 the same thing happened. I had recorded Far Cry 2 many times before though, without this happening. So now I knew this was not a problem with the game but with shadowplay itself. 

I have a theory that it may be something to do with framerate stutters whilst recording, but I desperately want to know if anyone else has had this problem as no one has seemed to have this problem after searching google, youtube or forums. So, please, if this is a problem that you have had or know about, please tell me. Or if you have a solutiong even better. Thank you."

nvidia,MrFluffykinz,26,1,"GTX 780 3gb vs 6gbHey all,

I'm doing a custom build ([link for those who might be interested](http://pcpartpicker.com/user/mrfluffykinz/saved/rkNgXL)) and I'm trying to decide what exact GTX 780 I'm going to get.

Right now I'm doing 1080p gaming but I do plan on stepping up to 1440p or even 4k in the future, with the same rig, when it becomes more cost efficient (I know this may require SLI, I'm willing to buy one or two more cards to make it happen).

Anyway, for that ""futureproofing,"" is it worth it to spend the extra ~$100 on a card with 6gb vram as opposed to 3gb? I know it's useful for games with a lot of mods, like Skyrim, but 3gb should be plenty for 1080p, so I'd imagine that since I'm going to have to SLI to perform at 1440p anyway, the 6gb shared vram should be enough (i.e. I shouldn't need 12ggb vram - 2 SLI'd 6gb cards).

I just read that last sentence to myself and it's super confusing, but I don't think I can put it any better...

Also, is there a preferred cooler or overclock system (windforce vs ACX vs lightning, etc) or is it all just marketing fluff?"

I'm using an Asus Maximus VI Gene and using my [V-Moda Crossfade LP Headphones](http://i.imgur.com/rAP0x7y.jpg) with the [BoomPro Mic attachment](http://i.imgur.com/Cct50yo.jpg).  I'm using the dual 3.5mm Y-adapter that it comes with it to connect each one to their respective ports (Audio out and Mic in). The other end is just a female 3.5mm and goes to the Mic which also attaches to the headphone.

In Windows (Using Win 8.1) in the default audio settings it recognizes it as a Microphone. [Pic of how it looks like](http://imgur.com/J9DZWt5). Also in Shadowplay settings it is marked to capture ingame and mic.

I'm also using RealTek HD Audio Manager that came with the drivers for my Mobo and here is how the settings show for [this](http://i.imgur.com/nixna91.png).

On Mumble [this](http://i.imgur.com/zCX3wag.png) is the configuration I have so it will work with my mic. 

Some questions/note worthy mentions:


* Do I need to use that Y-adapter or would my mobo recognize the audio AND mic from one cable if I just plug it into the Audio out?
* I tried enabling Listen to this device in the Microphone Properties and it does listen to me, but I also hear my voice delayed while doing so.

nvidia,rerre,10,4,"Drivers are crashingHey,

I bought a Geforce GTX 760 a few months ago and have had issues with it. My drivers keep crashing in some games: Every time I start warcraft 3 it crashes after at most 10 seconds and from there on it just keeps on crashing. Sometimes when playing dota2 while having a stream on my other screen it will crash (and after that it's just a constant crash fest). I find it very weird that I can play much more taxing games than warcraft 3 and not experience any crashes. Also in Payday2 if I alt tab ""too much"" my gpu core will go to 1/2 the speed and I will lag a lot (I read somewhere that the computer thinks it should run at 2d speed instead of 3d cause it thinks I'm alt tabbed but I'm actually in the game...?)

This is what I've tried to fix this issue:

Reinstalled windows, tested different drivers, downclocked my GPU core using MSI afterburner(this helped a lot actually, I couldn't even play dota2 before), tested mem cards for errors, and probably a lot more that I've forgotten about.

Specs:

8gb ram

Intel i5-2500k 3.30ghz

Geforce GTX 760

~~500W~~ 550W power supply (nvidia recommends 500W)

I'm kinda at a loss at what to try next, does my computer not have enough power (even though 500W is recommended)? Why is it crashing on seemingly low-taxing games, such as warcraft 3, but not in dota2/wow? Why is it downclocking my GPU core to shit when I alt tab?

Thanks.

nvidia,RoamingFox,3,3,"Control panel hangs when in surround modeEdit:
Resolved. Random symlink on my system was causing nvidia driver to install parts of itself across both my primary and secondary hard drives...


So I just upgraded to two GTX770 4gb in SLI and I've run into a very strange problem... The nvidia control panel hangs when in surround mode.

Here's where it get strange:

* Both cards work individually
* Both cards work fine in SLI (Maximize 3D Performance)
* Both cards work fine in Surround (ie. games play fine, no video issues)

It is *only* the control panel that locks up, and only when I'm spanning my three monitors with surround. Nothing else in my system is effected. No performance issues (yes even when in surround).

It seems to only hang when entering the following sections of the control panel: ""Configure SLI, Surround, PhysX"" and ""Adjust image settings with preview""

It is also worth noting that the Ctrl+Alt+S shortcut to swap between the two also hangs just like the control panel.

Things I've done/checked:

* Clean driver install (both with and without HD audio)
* Voltage on +12v rail (12.193v +/- 0.001v)
* Refresh rates on monitors are all 60hz
* Various positions of monitors on cards (primary vs secondary card output, etc)
* Physically swapped cards around
* Physically relocated SLI bridge to other fingers

edit:

* Driver rollback, no change
* Motherboard BIOS update, no change

Things I've not yet tried:

* Different SLI bridge (have one coming today)

Also I'm looking at buying a house so if I hold off till next year for the next chipset I may not be able to afford a card.  

Till yesterday I was bouncing around to stay ati or go to nvidia.  Ati would have been an easier decision as I would have went with VAPOR-X R9 290X 4GB GDDR5 TRI-X OC from Sapphire.

However nvidia is the issue I'm having and is why I'm posting.  I have narrowed it down to 2 cards.  They are:

EVGA GeForce GTX 780 Ti Classified K|NGP|N Edition
http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=03G-P4-3888-KR

GIGABYTE WINDFORCE 3X GHZ
http://www.gigabyte.us/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4890#ov

From what I have been able to find both are the top 2 when it comes to the 780 ti line.  The Gigabyte has been overclocked a little more than the EVGA and is cheaper.  However I have read that 2 issues people have had with it are build quality and that you can't overclock it much more than where it's currently at.  When it comes to the build quality though that has been something that is hit and miss.  Some say it's bad and other say it is a solid build.  As for overclocking I'm not sure if I would even bother with it till I water cool my PC.

The EVGA card on the other hand I have read has a lot of room to overclock however is built for people that are going to use LN2 to cool the card.  I never plan on doing that as the most I plan to do is at some point run an external water cooling system.  However everywhere I have looked if something of build quality was said it was always good.  The card costs more however if it has a better build quality and if EVGA has better customer service I think it's worth it when they get them back in stock.  

Thought I would ask here as I haven't really looked into a card in years and never a card that is of this level.  What do all of you think is the better card or is their a different card that I might want to consider.  "

For the last 2 days my computer has been crashing(black screen+ distorted sound) when i play a game(diablo3) and ive been trying to find whats causing it pretty much non-stop since it first started. The first few time the message didnt popup so i went trough the trouble of lowering the graphics, checking heat levels, repairing and then reinstalling the whole fucking game but everything seems fine on that end.

And then i started getting this [fancy message](http://imgur.com/dtlvmTz) but trust me it doesnt recover, it doesnt always blackscreen anymore but pc turns into a vegetable until i reboot... I tried to reinstalling the drivers but its hasn't fixed the problem or helped in anyway, I also checked for solution on both Nvidia and Diablo forum but nothing came from there so far.  

Problems seem to be worst when firefox+flash is running for some reason  

All help appreciated

nvidia,VaporousShadow,4,3,"Question about SLI with my 690OS: 64 Bit windows 7 Motherboard: MS - 7821 Processor: i5-4670k @ 3.40 GHz GPU: GTX 690 16 Gigs of RAM
I've had the PC for a bit and i'm starting to wonder if i have SLI enabled on the 690 or not. I had a Computer shop in town build it for me so that's part of the reason i'm uncertain. Using the ""show multi-GPU visual indicator"" option in the Nvidia control panel to check, I launched 2 different games (Dark Souls 2 and Battlefield 4) to see if it was working. [This](http://noble-press.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/0cb2251f_vbattach220620.jpeg) is what it should look like from my understanding, but when I use it the words ""SLI"" do not appear and only one green box shows up instead of two (I tried to get a screenshot, but steam was being finicky). Is this an indication that something is wrong with my SLI setup or is this normal for the 690? Thanks for any help you can offer."

Since then, I have tried almost every possible fix I came across on the internet but it is still not working. When I run a game, it will still show the icon, however it has a red cross going diagonally through the icon.

nvidia,XIV-Questions,6,1,"New Asus GTX 780 TI OC Direct CU ii - but monitors flicker and black out mid-game. What am I doing wrong?GTX780ti DC2 OC - Screen flickers and shuts off during gameplay.
Playing Archeage alpha or any game really with my new graphics card was shutting off my computer - as if it was unplugged from the wall. Happens randomly, and quite quickly into the gameplay. So - I ran to the store and swapped out my old Power Supply with a brand new digital Toughpower DPS 750w from Thermaltake.
Now whenever I fly around on my glider in Archeage, or play any game with a long view distance, the monitors flash off, the speakers start to hum, and the music from the game sort of starts gargling and stopping. The computer is still ON, but I cannot access anything and the monitors go black into power save mode. I have to reboot.

Setup:

* GPU: Asus GTX 780 TI OC Direct CU ii
* CPU: i7-4770k
* PSU: Thermaltake 750w Toughpower DPS, Digital
* Mobo: Asus Z87 Plus


GPU Temp wasn't going above 60c during gameplay. I have a case with 5 fans, all running in addition to the two on the video card itself. I tried shutting off the ""Power Surge Protection"" setting in Bios, and I updated Mobo bios to the latest version. Didnt help.
This did not happen with my old GTX 680.

My power supply has the PCI-E 6+2 cables that are ""2 in 1"", meaning that one cable coming out of the PSU forks and has two 6+2 inputs at the end, I'm assuming for easier SLI hookups. I am currently using both cables from the power supply instead of one that forks into two, despite it being able to fill both inputs."

I'm getting random CTDs when playing games along with a ""Driver has stopped working and has recovered"" error.
I've tried re-installing the drivers, it works for a few days and crashes again.
I've also gotten BSODs while browsing and no other apps running.

Another thing to note, GeForce experience won't open after a restart, I have to constantly reinstall it to make it work. After reinstalling it works until I restart the PC and then it won't open.

I've been using 334.89 for some time now, it's generally a bit more stable, no TDRs, but I'm getting some random BSODs, with most of them on system shutdown. 
Geforce experience still won't open.

Is there a way to rule hardware fault out ? I've run memtest for about 10 hours with no reported problems.

Should I contact Nvidia or Gigabyte regarding this issue? I really don't think it's hardware though. It's really driving me crazy.

nvidia,One_Half_Hamster,18,20,Tested: Nvidia's Performance-Boosting GeForce 337.50 Driver
nvidia,filben,4,3,"Do you think graphics cards could be more efficient?I get kind of annoyed by the performance of new games, lately. Latest example is Titanfall. Afaik it uses the Source Engine, looks anything beyond state-of-the-art, more like the avarage graphics (even on everything maxed) I would expect these days. But this game is giving me a hard time to get stable fps at 60. I already reduced most details to medium and even low but depending on map position the fps drops dramatically to something like 40 which is enough making the game less responsive. Another example is Far Cry 3, also average graphics but with horrible performance on my system, whereas games like Max Payne 3 can be maxed out on 1080p with 4x MSAA and still get around 50fps. Crysis 2 and 3 runs also smoother than Far Cry 3 and Titanfall by looking a lot better. Or just take Demonicon, a RPG with graphics about four years behind and there are a lot of scenes where I could not get more than 30 fps. Not to mention Call of Duty Ghosts horrible performance by not looking anything better then the previous installment.

I feel kind of screwed by the developers AND Nvidia/AMD. All those driver updates just handle the latest GTX 700s series with all the performance increases. Nvidia advertises Assassin's Creed Black Flag with a GTX 770 with slogans like, quote, ""if you want to take part in an assassin's life you NEED DirectX-11-Tessellation, HBAO+ and NVIDIA® TXXA™-Antialiasing-Technology for stunning graphics as well as NVIDIA PhysX® for a realistic experience"" (I translated it from my native language but yes, it says you NEED). I think there aren't interested at all in users with hardware older than the latest 700s series.

Titanfall pushed a contest every week giving away a GTX 780. Why on earth would I need that much graphics power for graphics like this? I cannot imagine that the raw performance of my GTX 570 (with Phenom II 965) is not enough to run mentioned games with decent fps. I think the devs aren't interested in optimisations since they always partner up with AMD or Nvidia and those companies want to sell their new generations. What a horror scenario if the hardware lasts three years (for maximum details, by lowering they last longer obviously ;) ) where the manufactors couldn't sell anything.

But looking at the prices I think it is hardly arguable to buy something like a GTX 770 for roughly €300 (roughly $400 I guess) just to enjoy SLIGHTLY enhanced graphics (if at all) at decent frame rates.

What do you think? Do you think the raw performance is higher than the output in many games which, if you think so, lacks a lot of performance optimisations? Do you think there is a game with state-of-the-art graphics that justify such an expensive upgrade after all? What are your thoughts on this?"

It seems I've always been one generation behind with my graphics cards so I'm really due. I just want to know if I will see a sizable difference or not. If I could jump from 50 FPS to a steady 60+ I would be happy. So is it worth it? I can get a 770 from my work for about 230ish because of my discount and a trade-in on an old cell phone. Thanks!

Let me preface by saying that I am decently computer savvy, but forgive me if I seem illiterate at some things. Anyways, here's the setup:

CPU: i5-3570K @ 3.4(not OC'd)
GPU(s): GeForce GTX 650 Ti BOOST(primary)
GeForce GTX 560 Ti(secondary)
RAM: 16GB
OS: Win7 64 Ultimate

Rig passes for everything except LED visualizer

Shield is on Android 4.4.2(Kit-Kat)
Kernal version: 3.4.10-gd447395

Router is an ASUS RT-N56U
Shield is on the 5 gHz connection.

Now, everything runs beautifully on my PC, but whenever I try to stream I get unplayable FPS drops(not seen on the PC(play them side-by-side for comparison)). Game-Streaming PCs Advanced Streaming Quality settings are currently set to Auto FPS and Auto bit rate (Using Wi-Fi). I've toyed around with those particular settings but I only get slight variations in performance, but still basically unplayable. I've tried multiple games and I see the same results.

What do you think the problem could be? It seems that I have everything properly adjusted and optimized to where I shouldn't be getting this low performance, so is the shield just not ready to handle streaming? This would be a huge let down for me as I am enthralled by streaming my PC games to the shield. Thank you for anyone who replies and I will give internet points to anyone who helps solve my issues!

I am running a GTX 560top and have had 2 screens connected to it for around 2 years now. The main one is a LED monitor which works 100% and the 2nd is an old 32"" 720p television connected via DVI.

(Without touching a cable or connection, if I roll back to 314 without even rebooting the TV comes back on.)

I downloaded the latest update for my Shield and everything is running smoothly with it and my PC. I understand there is a remote login feature for the shield and the new update. Right now I can only seem to get the shield to wake my PC but stops at the login screen. This does make some sense for security, but this forces me to open the on screen keyboard for Windows 8.1 and type in my password for Windows that way. 

Is this how it is done or am I missing something? I haven't seen anything in GeForce experience or shield settings about login settings for Windows, but I might be just blind and missed it somehow, or it simply doesn't exist and this is what we get.

Have to use on-screen keyboard in Windows to login after waking the PC when game streaming, is there a better way?

Out of nowhere today my GTX 760 started acting weird. Earlier I suddenly had lots of green pixels appearing everywhere and then disappearing a second later - this was especially bad in areas of the screen which had a colour gradient. Then lines began flashing - again, green.

I thought this was an overheat but speccy reported it was running at 35 celsius. I now see these green dots every now and then, though the PC hasn't had a full-on attack of them like it did earlier. That was fixed by restarting, by the way.

My card's about 6 months old. Having done some googling, the prognosis doesn't seem to be good. I still have all the paperwork, but I lack the box and stuff since I simply didn't have the room to store it. Will this be a problem when returning it? Do I contact Overclockers, the company I bought it from, or do I go straight to Nvidia or Acer (the manufacturer)?

Sorry for what must be a fairly basic question, I have never had to return a part before, and I just wanted to confirm that there's no other possible cause for this than bad VRAM - or, is there any way to confirm that this is the cause using software?

Just got my GTX 770 back from RMA and, upon reinstalling, it's running worse than my old ATI 5850. 

As far as I can tell, I've totally uninstalled all drivers for the old ATI card, I'm up to date on current NVIDIA drivers (335.23), but no dice.

Every game I try maxes out my GPU according to Afterburner. Dragon Age:Origins runs a measly 18-24fps. Same for Skyrim. Arkham Origins stutters through its opening videos slower than Christmas; I can't get to the opening menu. Mass Effect 3 dips from 18-40 fps. Oddly enough, Deus Ex:HR stays around 48-60fps at its highest settings. Afterburner shows my card fluctuating from 50-99% usage for Deus Ex.  

This wasn't happening prior to the card dying. I've checked task manager for my CPU usage- it stays around 40-70%, so it isn't bottle-necking from what I can tell. 

As I understand it, this card should be compounding frames on frames. Not sure why I'm even dipping below 60fps. 

Here are my specs in detail:

Gigabyte GTX 770 4gb OC

I7-950 @3.07ghz

6 GB DDR3 RAM

700 watt OCZ PSU

Evga x58 SLI mobo

I have an aging machine that is still good for my needs (CPU weak for Civ 5 it would seem).  So due to being Family man now and perhaps OLD (38 years old)I had sold my GTX 660 EVGA Super CLocked... just hated having card of that value siting almost unused.. however I always have the urge to play some RTS /Turnbased every now and then. I have always been good at and understand what I was getting with midrange and above Nvidia Cards since the TNT and even 3dfx Voodoo  LOL but my venture into AMD lowend midrange like 7750 was kinda suck back when it made waves for being what it was when I needed a new vid card and was going to try out competition...

 So I was thinking of Getting Perhaps 750 or 750TI like 750 TI because it has extra 6 pin for power stability over just PCI-E.  I realize it will not be GTX 660 power but as I say I only intend to play RTS Civ 5, Civ 5 BE and older stuff.  I will be gaming at 1080P and think I might just do a all out upgrade 2015 or even 2016 with INTEL and NVIDIA.  So Current spec is

This isn't the worst problem I've ever seen but it's something that bugs me.

Is there a way I can stop this happening? I use MSI Afterburner to find these numbers and verify the temps on HWinfo and GPU-Z also.

nvidia,TallonIV123,0,2,"Error with full screen games in 8.1 fixed!For the longest time i've had the problem of games crashing when first trying to load them up (assuming they were full screen by default). A hot fix for this was simply modifying the game files to play in window mode, or for some reason changing the compatibility mode to any other operating system (I'm on 8/8.1... yes this was tested on both after a full reinstall of windows 8 -.-) fixed the issue as well. I could not, for the life of me, figure out what was wrong. After fiddling with drivers (as I have an integrated card and dedicated gpu on my laptop) I determined it had something to do with Nvidia (as my intel card ran all the games no problem just with significantly less performance as expected). Turns out, Nvidia geforce experience was behind it the whole time. Uninstalling the drivers and re installing them fixed the issue but only until I restarted my computer... why? Because geforce experience would load up. After determining it had something to do with the program I figured maybe it was a setting within the program (as previously nothing caused this). Turns out the setting to ""automatically scan for games daily"" is the cause of this (under the preferences tab in the games section). With this setting enabled, every game crashes when attempting to run in full screen. Disable it? Everything runs perfectly fine. Now how this setting has to deal with games loading, I have no clue, but i'm hoping this post can bring to light the cause for this as i've had the problem for MONTHS now and have just dealt with it by changing the compatibility mode of everything. Maybe Nvidia can have a look at what's going on in there and how it affects windows 8 or 8.1, or maybe its compatibility issues with laptops, or integrated cards or something.

I'm looking for help. I have an ASUS ROG G53JW gaming laptop that came with an i5 M480 @2.67GHz and a nVidia Geforce GTX 460M. Recently, I've been having a problem  with the framerate progressively dropping as I play on my laptop until I get sub-20 framerates and the game becomes unplayable.

At first, I thought it was because my laptop was starting to grow old and that I was trying to play games that were above my pay grade, so to speak. But when I started observing the same thing while playing games like Anno 2070, The Witcher: Enhanced Edition, or even Banished... I started getting suspicious. 18 months ago I had a blast playing Mass Effect 3 or Skyrim on high graphics settings without any problems whatsoever, so seeing my laptop having problems running Banished seemed a little odd.

So today I tried reinstalling Skyrim and running it. As I know that I could play it without a problem just over a year ago, I thought it would be a good test. And indeed, I'm having the same rapid progressive decrease in FPS while playing that, going from 50+ FPS to below 20+ in just a few minutes on high settings, something I clearly did not have before.

So my question is, first of all, has anyone else encountered such problems? I've looked around on forums and reddit, but found nothing of help yet.
And secondly, do you guys think I should try reverting to an older driver (however it is you do that) or is my video card slowly dying out?

Just to explain, the video I'm dragging the brightness arrows to the left, to make it dark. It goes dark for one second, and then, with the tab all the way on the left side, it instantly reverts to super bright.

nvidia,BeornPlush,17,3,"GTX 760 / pilot 335 nightmareSo I buy a new EVGA GTX 760, put in the native 331 drivers, great fun, everything is dandy. Then, the 335 patch comes along. And so the nightmare begins.

5 minutes into a game of X-Com (hardly the biggest video card drain on the market, and it did work perfectly fine with driver 331), I get pink and purple sprites, then freezes, then green dotted lines, then BSOD [like this guy](http://www.reddit.com/r/nvidia/comments/1xi2ug/evga_gtx_760_green_dots_and_artifacts/). Except I didn't overclock.

So I check my connectors, nada. Uninstall/reinstall drivers, nada. Windows update, nada. Format my system, nada. Try running something simpler like the windows performance index, same green lines and crash. Try installing every stable driver from 331 to 335, nada.

It gets worse. After a few tests, the system got less and less resilient. I'm worried that actual physical damage was caused to the card by now, since after a format and fresh install of *everything*, any of the nvidia drivers will cause windows to boot up on a dead black screen. I can only boot up in safe mode or by uninstalling any and all video card drivers.

**System specs:**

* EVGA GeForce GTX 760
* Windows 7 SP1 64 bits
* Intel Core Duo 2 E8400 (3GHz)
* 6G RAM (pair of 2, pair of 1)
* Kingston SSDNow V Series 64GB ATA
* ASUS P5QL/EPU motherboard
* 500W Earthwatts power supply

Card is plugged into the power supply using the 2 adapters provided: 6+6 to 8 and 4+4 to 6 pins. Though it originally resembles a power/overclocking issue, I'm pretty sure I have enough power for it since it used to work fine until I installed patch 335.

I am having very similar problems as others are explaining. I need some help. 

I recently installed the 335.23 JUST to play Titanfall, and since then I have never played more than 30 minutes without a BSOD, crash, or black screen. The average time in-game is about 5-10 minutes before a crash, and the most common issue is ""Display driver stopped responding and has recovered"", and something about ""Kernel system error"", and goes back to Windows. The other times it is a BSOD with some sort of MEMORY_MANAGEMENT, or BAD_POOL_HEADER or some NV____.sys error and it freezes up.

I know it's not an overheating issue, AT ALL. Here's what I've tried: different GPU BIOS files, a wide range of clock and fan speeds, deleted all driver related files, ran driver uninstaller, reinstalled 335.23, CCleaner sweep, SFC /SCANNOW, CHKDSK /R on both my SSD and HDD, updated every possible hardware driver, installed every possible Windows Update, ran full MEMTEST diagnostics on both memory sticks, swapped memory sticks with a known good set, ran CPU, HD, VRAM stress tests, Western Digital HD diagnostics pass both extended tests, tried unplugging all unnecessary auxiliary components, ran ATITool (very stressful) for a few hours straight with no crashes, disabled Nvidia Audio Driver, and of course bone stock clock speeds on the CPU, RAM, and GPU/VRAM, Event Viewer tells me nothing important except ""Your PC rebooted unexpectedly""... 

Last night, I backtracked to 332.21 after a full driver sweep in Safe Mode which worked great for me, but unfortunately wasn't optimized for TitanFall.. I got an error before I even got in-game. I have never had ANY related problems since I started playing TitanFall with 335.23. Can anyone shed ANY advice?

EDIT: I don't HAVE to be in a game to get the errors now. I get the same errors in Windows sometimes as well, ""Display driver stopped responding"", BSODs, etc. I don't HAVE to be in a game, but it's not as common as in-game.

Full writeup:

###1. Requirements
---
Shadowplay (+enabled Hardware ofc), Virtual Audio Cable, Windows 7 or higher

###2. Guide
---
You need two different Virtual Audio Cables. You only have to set the driver-parameters to 2 or 3 and click on set. The rest isn't really in your interest. [Make it look like this.](http://i.imgur.com/UUuKCZv.png) On 64 Bit System you will encounter this error: http://i.imgur.com/WLW46lb.png | This is totally okay, just reboot your system and everything is set. 

Then you have to do some work with the software. Best solution is to rename your new Virtual Audio Cables in your Soundsettings. ([Rightclick the speaker symbol, click on playback devices.](http://i.imgur.com/FDJotxQ.png)) [Best solution is to rename ""Line 1"" in ""RECORD AUDIO"" and ""Line 2"" to ""NON RECORD AUDIO"". You just doubleclick the device and then you can rename it. Rename it on Playback and Recording respectively.] (http://i.imgur.com/nGXZW3n.png) Make ""RECORD AUDIO"" or ""Line 1"" you default playback device. All sound will now routed through that device and that's the audio-stream Shadowplay will grab later on.

Now comes the cool part. [You can set in the **Recording** Tab, that you want to listen to that output device. Playback it through the device you want to hear it.](http://i.imgur.com/FuHNBWT.png) Like Headset or in this case my regular speakers. This step has to be done for BOTH audio devices you run through. The rest is now piss-easy, since you have 2 different audiolines. 

#Example TeamSpeak 3:
[You just set your playback device to ""NON RECORD AUDIO"".](http://i.imgur.com/sQG8O8I.png)
#Example Foobar2000:
[Same rules apply here: Your playback output device is still ""NON RECORD AUDIO"".](http://i.imgur.com/M42fAnb.png)

Now you can record flawless ingame audio sound without TS chatter or Music running in the background. With the two lines, you have an easy time just changing the sound-sources you want to hear and what not. Check always the sound-devices to see, if the right sound is on the right line. And you don't have to rely on VACs Repeater Software which keeps crashing from time to time."

nvidia,[deleted],3,3,"560 Ti OverheatingLast night I was playing Skyrim. I monitor my temps while playing as I use mods and I'm always afraid of it getting too hot. Usually it gets around 70-80C, but I would say on average it hovers around 76C.

While I was playing it went almost instantaneously from 71C to 93C and climbing. I knew something was very wrong as the fans sounded like a jet engine taking off. I have never once experienced anything like it. I closed out of Skyrim as soon as I could get task manager to pop up. It got to 95C before I ended its process. I was not about to find out how hot it was going to get.

After I ended the game, the temps slowly went down and eventually stayed around 33C while I was just using Firefox.

I recently installed the newest driver, which I have no idea if that could cause anything like that but I figure I should mention it just in case.

I posted this on the NVidia forums too, but I wanted opinions here as well. It was suggested it might be going bad or something might be wrong with the fans or thermal paste. I *think* it's still under warranty so I wouldn't want to fiddle around with it too much out of fear of voiding the warranty.

I am usually good about cleaning out my computer but I had my boyfriend take a look at it today and he said he got *some* dust to come out but it didn't really sound like much or an amount that might cause the fans to get stuck and overheat.

I was thinking about installing an earlier driver to see if it helps but if that couldn't effect it I guess there really wouldn't be much of a point. I'm also a bit afraid to try again as I don't want it to fry itself.

**Edit:** I should probably also add it's NVidia brand GTX 560 Ti 1GB."

nvidia,ActionCactus,9,5,"Does Gsync help at lower framerates?I see that the articles about it keep listing three things that Gsync helps eliminate: tearing, input lag, and stuttering.  Most if not all of these articles completely ignore talking about the stuttering portion of that and just focus on tearing and input lag...

Tearing is something I experience very little of.  I play 5760x1080 so my framerates are usually not above 60 anyways.  Input lag is something I don't think I notice too often, so I'm not sure what a Gsync monitor will do for me there.

The one issue I consistently encounter is stuttering.  At this resolution it doesn't matter how much gpu power you have (I have a Titan currently; will be buying a second or switching to a more powerful 800 series card in Q1 when they're released), you will always see frame stutters because hardware just hasn't kept up with the software in terms of capabilities (at this resolution anyway).

**So my question is whether or not this Gsync does anything for me and every other gamer out there trying to squeeze as many frames as possible out of their budget rig?**  How does Gsync affect stutters?  Does it make them unnoticeable?  Does it reduce the effect of a framerate drop?

- Setting the ""Power management mode"" to ""Prefer Maximum Performance""

- Using Nvidia Inspector to force performance levels

- Using the Display Driver Uninstaller utility to wipe out all graphics drivers and reinstall them from scratch

nvidia,[deleted],6,2,"Nvidia control panel won't display (xpost pcgamingtechsupport, techsupport)**Win 7 running a GeForce GTX 560 Ti. Windows is up to date with all ""important updates"".**

**The issue**: Nvidia's control panel refuses to show itself. I've tried some solutions via Google but nothing has worked.


=====&gt; Edit: Downloading [this program](http://www.guru3d.com/files_details/display_driver_uninstaller_download.html) seems to have fixed the issue. I downloaded the most current version (12.2), ran it as recommended in the program, manually downloaded the most current driver for my system (334.89) and Nvidia Control Panel opened right up while I had GeForce Experience open as well. 


**Context**: I decided I wanted to mess with ENB in Skyrim and part of that is manually adjusting settings in Nvidia's control panel. As recently as last week I was in there tinkering with stuff, no problem at all; I was actually rather surprised by that at the time since this isn't the first time I've been unable to get into the Nvidia control panel. I've tried right-clicking on the desk top, going through Control Panel, creating a shortcut to place on the desktop, and clicking on the executable itself in the Nvidia directory. All I get is the little blue ""I'm working"" wheel for a few seconds, then that disappears and nothing pops up. That said, if I make several attempts (because that's productive, right?) I get a corresponding number of Nvidia Control Panel processes in Task Manager but no applications running.

**What I've tried**: Restarted; reinstalled Nvidia drivers in a clean install (according to Nvidia); used Add/Remove Program to uninstall everything Nvidia; used TuneUp Utilities to clean and repair the registry; checked the disk; let Nvidia's website pick my drivers, downloaded that, installed only ""Graphics Drivers"" and PhysX (skipped GeForce Experience and some other stuff). The search results I mentioned suggested going into Services and tweaking the automatic/manual setting for Nvidia Display, hitting the checkbox for ""Allowed to interact with the desktop"" and so on. Tried all of that, accomplished nothing, then reset it all to the way it started just to be thorough.

I've updated Windows NET Framework since that was mentioned as another possible cause (in search results). Nope.

I want to upgrade and am currently looking at the GTX 780ti, primarily the [e-VGA](http://au.evga.com/products/moreInfo.asp?pn=03G-P4-2884-KR&amp;family=GeForce 700 Series Family&amp;sw=) card.

I run the **single** 1980x1200 led monitor (120hz) and have a Corsair AX1200 PSU.

**Questions** 

- Would I see much of an increase in going with a GTX 780ti over the current 660 SLI setup?

- If yes, then would I see a further increase in going for GTX 780ti in SLI, or would that be overkill since I run the one monitor @ 1980x1200 i.e no visible increase.

However, with the drivers, my desktop flickers erratically, typically when I open a new tab in Chrome or when there's large movement on screen. 

However, I decided to perform some testing in-game and noticed no artifacting or graphical errors. In fact, I noticed no flickering whatsoever with v-sync active (some menus produced flickering, but never in-game). I'm not sure if this is a faulty GPU or some kind of driver issue, but any advice would be helpful. The problem persists even on older driver versions, but never without any drivers installed."

My (small) problem is that now whenever I play a game in surround, at a point not so far in to the session all three screens go black and audio gets messed up for a bit, then everything goes back to normal.  This only happens once in the entire session, and it's not in highly taxing rendering areas either (it's completely random when this occurs).

Batman works fine now, but it took quite a while to get it to start, for some reason after setting everything to Ultra, the game crashed and refused to work, like c'mon! Now it runs at really good frame rate (compared to black flag).

So as of last week, i've started to have odd issues with my MSi 770GTX where my computer would come out of sleep mode, but my monitor wouldn't come out of standby mode. After troubleshooting and reading online about other people having this issue, it did take some pressure off my shoulders knowing it was not a hardware issue. Another thing to note: although my monitor isn't waking up, i know my machine is running because as i tap my power button to shut down the PC, i can hear the speakers playing all of the normal shutdown noises (that little twinkle sound as the machine shuts down).

Until nVidia fixes this issue, here is my temporary workaround on this bug:

* when waking your computer out of sleep mode and your monitor(s) do NOT turn on, try hitting WINDOWS KEY + P (4) times which will trigger the built-in multi-monitor toggle.  This will force my monitor to wake up and give an error saying ""no projector is available"".

Again, i know for a fact that this is a software issue. When the computer wakes up i hear a usb/device sound disconnecting &amp; reconnecting, then my monitor will come out of sleep mode. when i only hear this sound disconnect, the monitor will not work until i do my trick above.

specs below:

* Windows 7 x64 Professional 
* ASRock z77 Extreme4
* i7 3770k (stock clocked @ 3.5GHz)
* 16Gb RAM Corsair
* MSi 2Gb Twin FROZR 770GTX
* SeaSonic 750w PSU
* Asus VQ248 144Hz monitor (issue happens with my spare monitors too running @ 60hz)

When I try it says the form is down for maintece.

CPU = core i5 650. &lt;- It is old, I know. 

GPU = GTX 760 Superclocked w ACX cooling

8 gigs of ram

Windows 7 64 bit with all updates installed on an Intel 530 series SSD.


Video and sound is output through HDMI to a Samsung 32 inch 1080p TV. &lt;- maybe this is the problem?

^EDIT^ I also tried a 22 1080p dell monitor over DVI. Same issue.


No extra software or bloatware is installed. 


NVIDIA GeForce Experience is EXTREMELY slow, it takes several minutes to actually load. Once it loads, usually takes about two minutes, the program works fine. However. whenever I click on the ShadowPlay button in the upper right hand corner, the program crashes.



Update: Clicking the shadow play button still makes GeForce Experience crash. I went to the resource monitor, found GeForce Experience, right clicked, and selected analyze wait chain. This is what it shows.

I went to my windows fire wall and made sure GeForce Experience had full privileges. I also made sure to set the process priority to high, as well ensuring that the GeForce Experience process was running as an administrator.

Any ideas???

So I've been encoding rough cuts of a 4 minute 1080p sequence from Premiere to 960x540 h.264 video with 2x multi-pass, and it would take about 3 minutes in Adobe Media Encoder. 

Then last night I noticed it was taking wayyyy longer than usual. It ended up taking about an hour to encode what normally takes 3 minutes. I didn't have time to troubleshoot it last night, but the only thing that's really changed recently are the new drivers.

nvidia,ThePrecursor,31,1,"Does anyone ever actually get their free games when they order a GPU?I'm pretty angry right now. Three times I've ordered a GPU under the impression and advertisment of free games. The fist two times were AMD cards, and both times the advertisements were removed the day after my order, and they told me I ordered too late.

So this time, I decided to upgrade to an Nvidia 760. I went to Nvidia's website and saw the bundle which gave a copy of AC4 and Splinter Cell, so I followed a link from Nvidia to Ebuyer's website, which had a banner up advertising the promotion. I then clicked a link on the banner, and was taken to the 760. I decided to buy from here since it was linked by Nvidia, and there was a banner on the site advertising it. 

So then I placed my order, and waited for the card to arrive (this was on Sunday). The card came yesterday, but still no sign of the games. I raised an enote, and customer support told me ""This promotion hasn't been advertised on our site since October"". Now that is complete Bullshit. The page was up, hosted on their site and working when I ordered the card. Hell, it linked me to the GPU I bought.

So I checked the page again, and surprise surprise, it's gone. The Nvidia web page link takes you nowhere. I'm currently waiting for the Nvidia page to come out of Maintece so I can link the customer support to it, and show they are listed there, but I know they won't give a shit.

So yeah, that was a bit of a rant. But does anyone else get this? The only seller people seem to discuss giving the codes is newegg, but I'm in the UK so can't order for them. Very disappointed, and angry that I just seem like a liar since the page was removed. "

These crashes are more like freezes, the screen freezes, audio loops/buzzes and computer is unresponsive for a while, then it starts working again, sometimes the machine needs a hard reset. They were a few, like once a day to start with, zero on a good day, but now they're getting more and more frequent and multiple a day.

The fan also seems to be spewing out what seems like hydraulic fluid, if anyone could confirm that the MSI version of this card uses fluid bearings, I can get this thing RMA'd.

I just re-organized my shrine and completely replugged my cords and cables to make sure my PSU (a thermaltake 650W, measured to be enough + headroomed for my machine) wasn't getting any interference from other devices, computer now runs solo on a wall socket.

Sometimes when the computer recovers from the freeze, it reports that either Nvidia driver has crashed and recovered or that the intel iGPU driver has crashed and recovered.

I've run multiple stress tests, kombustor, intelburntest, memtest etc but the machine hasn't frozen once with those running and they don't report any issues. Most often the machine freezes in Source-games and youtube videos and VLC.

**My main question here would be** that if the MSI card uses fluid bearing fans for the TwinFrozr, because then I'd have the easiest time getting this card changed."

However, I could not get it to work in Don't Starve (the only game I would consider streaming), which while it doesn't have a Experience Profile, is DirectX 9, which from what I read is the main requirement.

If I uninstall the ""Nvidia HD Audio Driver"" from control panel, the Geforce Experience app runs smooth, but the ""shield"" option goes away, as the streamer is also uninstalled, and then shadowplay is completely grayed out.

nvidia,juandemarco,1,3,"Question about nVidia Inspector.Hey there,
I have a question about nVidia Inspector, more specifically: am I doing it wrong? I read online that it's supposed to improve SLI performance on games not graced by an nVidia SLI profile, and it can be used to set custom AA and other neat stuff. I tried following various online howtos, even if it's pretty straightforward, but so far I am seeing zero improvements and/or differences from running the game without it. 

Let's take Shadow Warrior as an example: the newest beta has a SLI profile (and I can see there some improvements with it), but using the latest official driver there are slowdowns in certain points. I found the profile settings for nVidia Inspector, so I went on to:

1. Load the SW profile by selecting it from the dropdown
2. Hooking the .exe by clicking on the ""add program"" button on the toolbar
3. Configuring all the settings/bits that I found
4. I clicked on Apply Settings
5. I run the game with the Inspector open.
6. Nothing. No difference.

The same happens with any other game I've tried it with, for example The Witcher 2, which on a dual Palit GTX 770 JetStream 4GB drops from 90FPS to 20FPS in certain points for no reason - the inspector is supposed to help, but does exactly nothing. I also looked for some AA compatibility bits and applied them alongside a custom AA setting on a couple of games, but saw no result whatsoever. 

Is there some secret trick I'm missing out on? Do I have to enable/disable something somewhere else? Is it all a lie? :)

Thanks!

nvidia,freakofnatur,5,0,"Nvidia Surround not worth it.I got 3 1080p monitors on black friday and paired them with two 780s in SLI. I thought it would be amazing but the Surround drivers are chuck full of super annoying bugs and glitches. If you try to use surround + 1 there is so much fail.

1st off, Window snapping is completely broken with an extra display. So when you try to fullscreen a program it literally goes fullscreen across all 3 screens. The only way to fix this is with an extra gpu for the extra screen.

2nd, Microsoft Silverlight and Nvidia Surround are completely incompatible with each other. That means my $2500 gaming rig is incapable of playing a simple Netflix movie.

3rd, If I want to turn Surround on and off none of the settings are saved. This means reorganizing monitor configurations, resetting the resolutions and re-adding the bezel corrected resolutions *Every. Fucking. Time.* This is a major pain in the ass and the primary reason why I have given up on Netflix on my Gaming PC.

4th, The 4th screen requires a Display Port connection if running from the 780s. Even though there are 4 DVI ports on two 780s it doesn't matter, you can only use three with Surround enabled.

5th, This isn't Nvidia's fault so much as the gaming industry but it impacts their surround feature so Ill put it here anyway.  Many games are missing FOV options or are lacking Ultra-wide support altogether. The FOV in many games *severely* distorts the image on the far edges of the screens to the point that you cant even tell what you are looking at.

TLDR, Surround very cool but not worth the glitches for every day use."

I have had both cards working in SLI yesterday, but the display output kept crashing to my monitor (QX2710 EvoII.

I have my monitor set to 96Hz which is below the 400MHz pixel clock rate that sometimes messes up SLI configurations, so I'm effectively ruling that out. Also, I had the 96Hz overclock working perfectly fine with just a single card installed.

I then added the second card in, booted into Windows fine, and even got SLI configured. I thought I was golden, but within a minute the display just went dark as if there was no input to it. The display never corrects itself and I am forced to hard reset the system. When I boot back into Windows I have no option for the Nvidia control panel, and it appears that the driver is being overridden as my resolution is super small.

I don't think the cards are defective, or else they wouldn't work at all correct? I am running the second newest BIOS for my motherboard (ASUS P8Z77-V Pro) as the newest BIOS strangely doesn't seem to even let Nvidia Control Panel see my second GPU.

I am completely out of ideas and would just like to get this setup going as I've spent two entire days working on this issue.

I originally posted this on /r/techsupport but I guess that was the wrong place...


I have had issues with newer versions of the drivers for the 560ti, my computer would freeze, almost as if it is about to BSOD, but then returns after 5-10 seconds. This has only happened with newer drivers.


It has prevented me from updating my graphics driver for quite a few months now and I was hoping someone may know of a recent-ish driver I can update to without fearing this issue coming up again.


Currently I am using the 314.22 driver as its the only driver I know works (without going even further back)


Please, does anyone know of a more recent driver that would be safe for me to update to?

The system boots fine since i just use my external display (VGA, no HDMI available on my screen) anyway so i don't have any issues at the moment. But since i never updated my drivers since i purchased it (~3 years ago) i would like to give it a go.

**However, my laptop keyboard is broken** too so i can't really press Fn+F7 to toggle through the display modes to enable my external screen again if that would be required for whatever reason.

So i'm here trying to figure out what other people think about my situation. Can i install the driver and make sure my external screen will be used after the (probably) mandatory reboot? (Win 7, x64)

It was perfect prior to that update (patch 320.49) After reading some forums I decided to reinstall an older driver. I re-installed driver 320.18. It worked great. But then I was constantly asked to update to the latest driver. I waited until patch 331.58. I didn't install patch 327.23, which is the patch after 320.49. Needless to say I started having the same issues with game animation. I was aggravated. So I decided that deleting all Nvidia programs and files and then re-installing them would work. I used a program called ""Display Driver Uninstall."" It worked. I was able to delete all Nvidia files and folders. The problem was after I re-installing the drivers.

nvidia,AirDrawnDagger,9,2,"PhysX apparently broken for all games/appsHi folks, wondering if a PhysX guru might be able to help me here.  I purchased a Gigabyte GTX 670 2GB card in May, and built my computer that same month.  The card has been working without any problems, except one: I cannot run any PhysX-enabled games or apps on the GPU.  All the games I've tried it on (Planetside 2, Hawken, Metro: Last Light) crash within a minute of launching, and I usually get an error saying something like ""the driver has recovered from a problem"".  As soon as PhysX is turned off, the games run beautifully with no other issues.

Originally I thought that maybe Planetside 2 and Hawken were just buggy and I had to wait for them to update before I could turn on PhysX, but the same thing kept happening.  Last night, I downloaded FluidMark and the PhysX fluid simulation from nVidia.  Sometimes they crash, and sometimes they keep running, but they don't render any PhysX particles with the GPU.  In FluidMark, the particles will appear for a moment, but then disappear, and the counter that says ""GPU particles rendered"" will drop instantly from thousands to zero.  In the nVidia fluid sim, I can hit a key to switch between GPU and CPU PhysX rendering.  As soon as I switch to CPU rendering, particles appear and move with physics.  When I switch to GPU, there are no particles rendered at all.

I've removed all nVidia drivers, restarted in safe mode, and used Driver Sweeper to erase all traces of drivers, then rebooted and installed drivers from scratch via GeForce Experience.  In the nVidia control panel, I've set the GPU to specifically run PhyX instead of auto-switching to the CPU.

I'd really appreciate any input on this, as it's currently driving me a bit nuts.  I'm thinking it must be a software issue (maybe a conflict with another app?), but I'm also wondering if it's possible for a hardware failure to disable PhysX.

I have an EVGA reference 570, nothing special at all. I've noticed games like Bioshock Infinite and such chugging at low resolutions. Part of this is undoubtedly the six-core AMD I thought would be good for gaming. I'm correcting that with an Intel tomorrow. However, I wanted to get your guys' opinions on cards: Is it worth an upgrade to a 770 this generation, or should I wait for the 8 series? For reference, my previous upgrades were GEforce 4 MX (Integrated, back before integrated were OK) to 9800, then 9800 to 570. While I don't have any illusions about the bump from dx8 to dx10 to dx11 being similar to the bump from 570 to 770, but I thought I'd get opinions even so.

nvidia,Karnadas,0,1,"Any idea why brightness seems to be different even though Nvidia Control Panel shows otherwise?Hey everybody at /r/nvidia!

The problem that I'm having lately is that through Nvidia Control Panel, I adjusted the settings for my monitors (I have two, the main monitor which is hooked up via HDMI, and the other is hooked up through DVI) yet after quitting full-screen applications or sometimes after I unhook then re-hook up the HDMI, my main monitor's brightness has been increased. I will open NCP and if I move the slider the smallest amount I can down, the brightness on the screen snaps lower. If I move the slider back to exactly what it was (42% for me), the screen is noticeably darker than it was before I made any changes. To make it easier to describe:

* I set the brightness on my HDMI monitor to 42% and it looks great.

* I start a full-screen application (Let's say Saint's Row IV, since this happens 100% of the time with that), and then quit later.

* My screen is noticeably lighter, and looks quite frankly bad.

* I open NCP and click and hold on the brightness (for all channels) on my main monitor.

* If I move the slider 2% to the left, the screen's brightness suddenly decreases, sharply.

* If I move it back to 42% from the 40% I had just moved it to, it gets barely any brighter, but it's back to where I like it.

I've been having this problem for a while and some googling the issue didn't bring me a lot of results (though I could have just not looked properly, I admit).

I was hoping somebody around here could help me figure out the problem.


Extra details just in case they're necessary, I have the GeForce Experience installed, all drivers are up to date. I have Geforce GTX 560 gpu (mini-HDMI to main monitor, DVI to secondary monitor), AMD Phenom II X4 970 CPU (it was a Christmas present), and I'm using Windows 7 professional 64bit.

Unfortunately, there is no solution to the VLC issue, which apparently has affected the program since version 2.0.0, and isn't dependant on what videos you feed it to chew up. It's just an issue with the player, and I don't think it's going to be fixed anytime soon.

The washed out colors can be fixed, though. You have to disable ""Use hardware YUV -&gt; RGB conversions"" which is in the Video tab in Preferences. That will at least make them have the proper contrast.

I'd assumed from various impressions and q and a's online that continuous recording was possible. This does not appear to be the case. The program will stop recording after the output file has reached 3.8 GB and will not start a new recording after that file size limit is reached and the recording saved. I'd assumed it would just continue spitting out more ~3.8 GB files until I hit the stop manually recording, but that's not the case.

This is especially irritating since the output size of a 1080p file running 10:41 yields a 3.8 GB file, thus making manual recording pointless over the shadow recording that nets you a full 20 minutes.

The quality of the recordings are great, seems like these are pretty glaring issues that are hopefully resolved early in the beta stages."

nvidia,DouchePaste,17,16,"Shadowplay Quick-Fix GuideSo I've noticed a lot of people have similar issues with Shadowplay but they seem to stem from a lot of misunderstanding, so this little guide is my attempt to help fix a lot of issues people encounter.

Here's a quick list of things that everyone who encounters any major issues should try before anything else:

* Make sure there are no games running when you enable Shadowplay for the first time (which does cause a modeset, which is normal).

* With no games running, disable shadowplay and wait about 10 seconds (this is to confirm that the process ""nvspcaps64.exe"" is automatically terminated) then re-enable Shadowplay and start your games.

* SURROUND MODE IS NOT SUPPORTED, STEREOSCOPIC 3D IS NOT SUPPORTED.If you attempt to use Shadowplay with these modes, any issues you have are your's alone.

* Shadowplay does NOT support OpenGL games at this time (Minecraft, Amnesia: TDD, etc.) nor does it support games NOT running in true fullscreen mode. Make sure the game you're attempting to record is both a DX9 or higher title, and that it's running in FULLSCREEN. Not windowed, not 'borderless', full screen.

* If all else fails, uninstall the Geforce Experience via the control panel's ADD/REMOVE programs menu, then perform a CLEAN reinstall.

Common misconceptions:

* ""Shadowplay only records to the C drive.""

This isn't true. If this appears to be causing issues, run through the above steps and see if it persists. If it does, there is something funky with YOUR system.

* ""Because Shadowplay records at 62.XX FPS, the videos are sped up.""

False. Not only is this logic wrong (higher frame rates played back at lower speeds cause a 'slow-mo' effect, not a 'speed-up' effect) but unless you force a video player to playback at a fixed frame rate, it will just play back the media with the same timestamps that it's encoded with. the 62.XX FPS is a result from them capturing a frame every 16ms. VLC, WMP, etc. will play the videos at whatever frame rate they are given.

* ""3.8GB limit? I've recorded longer files than that!""

This size limit comes from limitations built into .MP4 muxing in Windows 7. The same limit is not present in Windows 8 or higher. Windows 7 users will have a 3.8 BG limit on manual mode, and a 10 minute maximum Shadow length. The 3.8 limit will vary the maximum length, but on high setting it will average around 10-15 minutes. On low setting (and especially on less demanding games) manual recording length can easily exceed 20 or even 30 minutes, or course at the cost of quality.

I just built my rig and prior to updating the drivers, it looked very nice on the TV. Looked crisp, sharp, just overall good. However, I updated the drivers since this is an entirely new build and downloaded 331.65. I was able to immediately notice a slight difference (I've been using 1920 x 1080p as the resolution before and after the driver update). 

After the update all text looked a little choppy, I would say blurry but it's not entirely blurry. Videos look like they're in lower resolution even when played in 720, or 1080. I did a rollback to no drivers at all and the resolution came back. I installed 331.65 again and same results.

So, what should I do? I tried to look for some older drivers but wasn't sure which one I should use and I think I tried 285 (found a thread where someone suggested it) but it said it wasn't compatible with my system. 

My specs are:

* MSI Gaming Geforce GTX 760

EDIT: On the side note, when I do play a game it changes my TV resolution from 1920 x 1080p 60Hz, to just 1080p. It pops up in the corner of my TV everytime it changes resolution.

So, what do you guys think? Any 680/770 owners, or overclockers, or general smart guys have thoughts on the matter? Would I be sacrificing significant lifespan (i.e. 20%+) if I went with the 770, and for what kind of performance gains?"

(What happens: game (and/or computer) either freezes completely or the application crashes to desktop (drivers stop responding/working).)

Upgraded to the new drivers today, and jumped in for some new multi-player action.  Got through a single game, no problems.  Second game loads up; game crashes.  Now, I can't go a full game without crashing.  I'm not sure what the problem is, but this also happened in the BF4 beta (single game, fine - anything after that, crash after crash.) (I know, Beta.)

 - Intel Core i7 4770
 - 16GB DDR3 (meets requirement)
 - GeForce GTX 670 (331.65) (outperforms the required GTS 450, which is minimum required, the recommended 760 was quoted as being only a *slight* performance boost above the 670, which is why I went with the 670)

nvidia,[deleted],3,0,"Dear Nvidia, the jerk store called and said they were running out of you!Dear Nvidia, 

FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING FUCKSTAINS! 

2009. My lovely wife gives me a Cannon HD camcorder as a Christmas gift. A wonderful gift, as our first daughter was due to arrive in about a month. The only computer we had was a Sony viao laptop with a 1.8 Ghz dual core processor and 1Gb of RAM. Anyway, the laptop would freeze anytime you tried to open one of the AVCHD files from the camera. We had to get a new computer. 

We put together a workstation with a zippy processor, 16Gb of fast RAM and a Nvidia GeForce GT 420M video card. Should be totally capable of handling our video editing needs. I set it up with Windows 7 and PowerDirector (which was known for being fast and easy to use). We did it on the cheap by using newegg and Amazon and it came up to about 2 grand. Kind of a tough pill to swallow to say the least. 

It never really worked right. The videos would load, but the poor performance of the preview screen made it almost impossible to actually edit anything properly. For example, if you dropped an AVCHD clip in the timeline and chose to edit this clip, the preview screen would pop up but when you click play,  the video doesn't play and a bar pops up that says ""rendering"" forever. If you double click play, a micro second of video will play, but then ""rendering"" forever. By double clicking like a motherfucker, you could kind of half ass edit a clip, but it always came out horrid. After a while, I gave up on trying to edit anything, I just used the video editing software to convert the AVCHD files into something more useful. This made it so I hardly ever worked with video on the computer. 

In early 2012,I decided to upgrade the workstation so that we could actually edit videos. Basically everything was replaced except for the video card and the power supply. This time I overclocked an intel 2600k quad core processor to 4.2Ghz (completely stable and cool) and used 32Ghz of super fast RAM. This thing had to crush any video file. 

Loaded everything up and it actually worked pretty well. Everything worked fluidity and I was anle to actually work with the AVCHD  clips. Then, about a week later it went back to being slow as shit. WHAT THE FUCK!? 

I fucking checked everything. All the hardware passed extensive benchmarking tests and was humming along. Nothing else was loaded onto windows. All of the useless crap was uninstalled. All of the settings were optimized for performance. Viris scan,  clean. My Nvidia driver was fucking updatef for Christ's sake... But no, this shit keepd happening like theres some kind of asshole ghost who haunts me only by fucking with my video editing software. So again, after years of frustration and thousands of dollars spent on tons of hardware and software, i still csnt edit shit. This is like the fucking fastest shit on the plant with the os on a SATA3 motherfucking ssd. I have no words for the levels of frustration and insanity that this situation caused me over the years. 

Like a month ago, I decided to Google this problem again and a few links down I find a question posted to a forum by a user with a similar Nvidia graphics card and problem. Another user mentions that any Nvidia driver after 301.42 breaks video editing capabilities. I almost shit bricks as I rushed to check the version I was running. I was running version 311.someshit,  so I downloaded 301.42, loaded that shit up and PowerDirector ran smooth as butter. BUTTER. 

A few days later, PowerDirector was slow as shit again. I was fucking furious. It turns out that Nvidia drivers are set to auto update by default. I just unistall the auto updater altogether and reinstall 301.42. Ok,  butter. 

A few days later, shit is broke again. Drivers are updated and the auto updater is reinstalled. WHAT THE SHIIIIIIIT? 

A quick Google search revealed that Windows update also installs Nvidia updates, so I turned all that shit off, reinstalled 301.42 and uninstslled the auto updater. Buuuuter, and now I think it for good. 

So, im pissed at Nvidia for all the headache that this driver bullshit caused because you jerks always advise you to update to the latest version...  

ASSHOLES!

I first encountered this problem while running GeForce 320.18 Driver - WHQL where my PC would boot up fine &amp; I could see the windows 8 logo - then as soon as it switches to the login screen, my monitor just went blank.

After diagnostics and repairs and finally a fresh reinstall, I finally realised it was the 320.18 driver that was giving me all the trouble, so I rolled back to GeForce 314.22 Driver - WHQL which seemed to have solved all my problems for over 2 months - until this morning. Even last night it was still working perfectly - so I'm trying to find out if I may have installed something during the day that only took effect after a reboot.

It seems nothing works now. I've reseated the Gfx card &amp; uninstalled all drivers &amp; I'm able to use the gfx card in 800x600 mode if all nvidia drivers are removed from my PC. However, the minute I install GeForce 320.49 Driver - WHQL, I'm back to square one.

I'll try roll back to 314.22 and do a system restore or some such, but have any of you encountered this problem and are maybe able to assist?

Many thanks

nvidia,PhedreRachelle,6,3,"Two different computers, exact same problem at the exact same time. Help?**SHORT VERSION ON THE BOTTOM** 

My boyfriend and I each have an Nvidia EVGA card. That is where our similarities end. I have a 560, I believe his is a 480. 

As for the rest of the computer, we have completely different RAM, motherboard, power box, etc. Even our monitors are different. We are both computer people and built these ourselves, all parts in each computer are perfectly compatible. In fact I have not had a single issue on my computer since I built it, including after upgrading this video card a year ago. We also regularly play video games. I use the highest settings (usually) with no glitch

So here is the issue. Civ 5's expansion came out, and we wanted to play it. We started it on my boyfriend's computer first and noticed some twitchy graphics. His computer isn't as high performing anymore, so we turned the graphics down and didn't think much of it. Then I went on, started a LAN game, and he joined me. Now we were both experiencing twitchy graphics. This was a little odd, since my computer can usually handle graphics just fine. But we figured it was a heavy game, turned down the settings, and played half a game.

Apparently this was a mistake. My boyfriend noticed his fan was running really high, so he installed SpeedFan. Sure enough, GPU was reading at about 91C. So I installed it as well, and was reading about 78C. We turned all fans to 100%, and the GPU temp remained the same, and CPU and CPU core were slowly heating up. We assume this is because of the GPU. 

So my boyfriend rolled back his drivers, and all temps immediately went down to normal (when I say immediate, I mean it only took a minute or two, not instant, this is not a temp reading error). I did the same, same result. So we restarted the computers and tested again. Temps back up to 91 for him and 73 this time for me. So we updated new drivers. Again, fixed the issue. We restart. Temp is high again. So now we decided to install nTune so we can have control of the GPU fan as well. Next huge mistake

When he tried to access nTune, he got the blue screen of death. When I just tried to accept the license agreement, I got the blue screen of death. I immediately uninstalled mine, he kept his. When he clicked a feature in nTune, he again got the blue screen of death. 

Finally, I turned my fans back up again to check if it would reduce the temp. This time, my computer started to make a clicking sound. I turned the fans down, the clicking continued, and then my computer shut down. I got the angry red light on my mother board and the high pitched sound you can barely hear. Since the last time I experienced this was with a corrupt video card, I immediately removed mine. 

I have now opened my card up, and the thermal paste does not look normal. 

My question is - is there any hope? My computer shutting down to protect itself in addition to the blue screen of death makes me concerned the hardware is damaged somehow. The appearance of the thermal paste and our ability to manipulate drivers to fix the temp makes me hope its not the hardware, and its just acting buggy because of the thermal paste.

Any ideas?

---

***SHORT VERSION***  
*1. Played Civ 5 on two computers with same make but different models of video cards. Choppy graphics  
2. Next day major GPU heating issues on start up  
3. Heating issues resolved when drivers are changed (and they stay resolved, even when testing with high performance games. The issue only returns on start up)  
4. nTune causes a blue screen of death  
5. One of our computers shut down to protect itself  
6. Thermal paste looks pretty bad on opening up the video card*

Is this hardware, or might we be able to save our cards?

And for curiosity - How could this happen? Obviously if graphics are funny I'll stop playing the game in the future (or at least check the temp readings), but I'd really like to know exactly how this messed up my computer in such a way

If you need specs or specific temp read outs just let me know. If there is a better place to post this, please let me know"

tl;dr// Two different, personally built computers displayed the exact same GPU heating issue. 

We found out what it was, and it is something that could affect your CPU as well. It was a bitcoin miner

First item: The bitcoin miner was installed the day before we used Civ 5. The issues appear unrelated, other than causing the graphics card to run even hotter. That is what caused us to start looking, so really it was a good thing. 

What happened: Something that we did on the 10th installed a bitcoin miner on the computer. This happened to both of our computers because we typically share files and download links through the home group. Usually its fun and we feel cool with our computers in a relationship just like we are, this time not so fun.

Well, this folder installed on the 10th: ""C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Time."" This is a hidden folder. Only 1-3 processes show up in task manager, the rest is entirely hidden. It does a serious number on your computer. In our case, it attacked the GPU, but we understand  these can attack the CPU as well. Malwarebytes doesn't pick it up, or any anti-virus protection. Essentially all security missed this initially and could not find it on a scan. 

The funny part is the whole time I kept telling my boyfriend ""I swear, its acting exactly like its being used. Its as if something is telling it to process something."" Instead of believing my own hunch, I had to go and tear apart the graphics card. To be fair, it had crashed my computer. But I really need to start listening to myself.

Anyways, this guy is really hard to get rid of. Check your CPU and GPU temps. Heck, even do a clean up just to be safe. We needed Rogue Killer to kill all the processes and then ComboFix to delete the miner. Even using ComboFix, you have to tell it to delete the folder and its registries. This new terror is extremely clever and tenacious. Or I am dumb and it got the best of me

**tl;dr// IF YOU HAVE ANY PERFORMANCE ISSUES, CHECK FOR A BITCOIN MINER USING ROGUE KILLER**"

Years ago when ATI Radeon came out I bought their 9800 xt 256mb card for $400 to replace my Generic GeForce 2 card and play EQ at higher settings. It did make the game look much better however, the frames dropped to shit, and when putting it in the lowest settings possible it still played like ass. I put back in my GeForce 2 card and gave away my Radeon. Though the detail wasn't there anymore my frames were stellar with clip planning way up.

Nearly a decade later and a franchise buy out, I purchased the 7970 thinking this card is going to be totally sweet and all those weird anomalies with ATI would be gone. I was wrong on so many level.
Getting eyefinity setup for one is a massive bitch (and it makes me motion sick but not their fault), secondly the drivers are constantly crashing and makes my main screen unusable (yes updated, yes rolled back, yes reconfigured, yes I've done EVERYTHING I could with them), I thought it was originally the display port adapter, but didn't matter which monitor that was attached to. The Catalyst control center has a learning curve worse than emacs, and it is nothing more than glorified windows display settings that constantly fail, and what I gather you need to use it with AMD cards. It's constantly rotating the line up of my monitors where ever the hell it wants to go and a pain in the ass to get set back up. And finally, when playing AMD endorsed games, in my well ventilated case and cool ambient air room temperatures, after an hour of playing, it over heats and crashes my computer.

I remember debating in my head too, should I get the 680 for $100 more or give AMD a chance to redeem
themselves. Such a bonehead move, and to resolve the over heating issue I needed to drop another $200 on a 3rd party after market cooler.

I hope AMD employees get the chance to read this as I furiously give the middle finger to my display setup."

My current card is a GTX 660 (MSi brand), before that I had a GT 430 and before that I'm not sure. Whenever I attempt to use the VGA out on these cards, I get blurry pixels.

If I use other VGA sources on the same monitor -- a 2006 HP laptop, an ancient Mac Performa, an SGI box, etc -- they all look crisp and beautiful.

What gives? Is there anything I can do about this? Or is clean VGA just not something modern hardware bothers with?

I've considered investing in a standalone DVI-&gt;VGA converter box, but they're generally pretty expensive, and the cheaper ones have limited VGA bandwidth which I guess translates into low refresh rates at higher resolutions (60Hz etc -- painful). And one of the reasons I love this monitor is that I can run it at 2048x1536 to show renderings and stuff, and none of the converter boxes I've seen can handle that. At that resolution blurry pixels don't much matter, but for other usage, I'd like crisp pixels. (This monitor is pretty far away and I like being able to run at 1280x960, for example).

Edit: Despite enjoying the fact that I **can** run this monitor at ""iPad resolution"" (2048x1536), I typically only use it at 1280x960. And that's where the blurriness is most noticeable."

My SLi setup has been giving me some hell, for example:

 - Microstuttering just got way more noticeable: Games as simple as TF2 got random stuttering moments when FPSs seem to go through the roof (&gt;300fps) but I don't really have more than 1-3fps.

 - The power consumption and thermal output: It is summer. I live in the south of Spain. Even though they are watercooled, the radiators are still throwing that hot air to my room. And it is starting to get quite annoying, let alone the fact that they suck a lot of juice. Also, this would let me remove my backpack XSPC RX360 and stick with only my GTX360 Black Ice. 

 - VRAM. 1GB is not enough for games such as BF3 anymore.

I'm looking to upgrade my graphics and I will probably upgrade my cards every 2-3 years and I'm looking at maintaining ultra settings while paying as little as possible proceeding into the future.

I built my first PC with a gtx460 1gb and upgraded it with another 460 running in SLI about two years ago.  I've thoroughly enjoyed my pc and have been able to run just about everything on High settings until my recent monitor upgrade to the new ultrawide 29"" LG monitor 29ea93 (I believe that's the model number).

Well pushing graphics on that thing (2560x1080) has brought my Tomb Raider settings down to Medium.  It looks great, couldn't be happier, but I'm also a bit of an enthusiast, and I want to tinker with a new build.

Now I'm aware I've got some other issues to worry about such Haswell and new chipsets, but lets limit this to video cards for now.  What do you guys think is the best pattern for upgrades to maintain ultimate settings on a greater than 1080p gaming monitor for the least amount of cash?  

Examples:

680 (4gb) ---&gt; 680 (4gb) sli ---&gt; 800 series

780(3gb) ---&gt; 780 (3gb) sli ---&gt; 900 series

I hope this is getting the idea across...

nvidia,fishy007,8,2,"GPU CoolingHey Guys, I may be on a wild goose chase here, but I was wondering if there is a way to keep my card cool and limit the amount of heat transfer to my office.

I've got a Gigabyte GTX670 running on an Asus P8Z77-V Pro mobo. My CPU is an i7-3770k with a Corsair H100 liquid cooler. Everything runs well, but the graphics card seems to be heating up the room even when I'm just doing coding or word processing in Windows. I believe it's the graphics card as I removed it for a day to run my monitor with the onboard video and my office didn't heat up as much (there was a 3C difference in temp which is quite significant for me). My office is very small and the door is often closed (to keep the pets out). Even the heat from a hot router can heat it up a fair bit.

So I'm wondering if perhaps a liquid cooling system would be better for the card. My limited knowledge of physics says that this wont work as the heat has to go somewhere. If the GPU produces x units of heat, changing the cooling solution won't make it produce fewer units of heat.

If I'm correct in that assumption, changing to a liquid cooler won't work. If that's the case, does anyone know if it's possible to set up the system so that the GPU is only active when I'm playing a game that needs it? I've tried setting something like this up about 18 months ago, but it didn't seem to work.

Any constructive thoughts are appreciated.

As far as I am aware my two 570's should be able to do this however I have been told that it only works with uniform resolution screens. Thx in advance.
nvidia,Gonzeau,1,2,"3 Monitors on GTX 560 Ti 448 Cores Limited Edition???Hi people, first excuse my bad english, it's not my natice langage. So I'm new to this subreddit, and as stated I have a GTX 560 Ti 448 Cores Limited Edition, and I would like to run 3 monitors on it, the two first being computer monitors plugged as DVI, and the third one being a TV plugged as HDMI. The card actually only detects 2 monitor at a time so I was wondering if there is a program or something to be able to use those 3 screens at a time. Also if this may help the TV could be used as a clone of my first monitor, so if there's a program that could do that it would also work. 

Thanks alot!!!!!"

nvidia,Miniappolis,21,1,"So my HD 7750 is almost dead, advice on a new cardI've been looking at this: http://www.umart.com.au/newindex28.phtml?id=10&amp;amp;amp;bid=5&amp;amp;amp;sid=96890

Would this run Just Cause 2, Planetside 2 and other games like them on high with no problem?

Also I noticed a 6 pin socket on one side, I don't have a plug for it. Will the card come with some adapters or do I not need the socket? 

New territory, sorry for obvious questions


Edit: DANGIT, wrong card. I meant this one: http://www.umart.com.au/pro/products_listnew.phtml?id=10&amp;id2=&amp;&amp;bid=2&amp;sid=99232

nvidia,squidred,1,4,"Blue screen with Nvidia Geforce 555M!I have a Lenovo Y570 with dual graphics cards: Intel and Nvidia GT Geforce 555M. There's a cool little Optimus switch that lets me change between them.

Except whenever I try to run a game (from Minecraft to Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 to Skyrim) with the Nvidia card activated, it gives me a blue screen. Fifty percent of the time, after the blue screen, the Nvidia card has a code 43 under the device manager that goes away after I uninstall the driver and then scan for hardware changes to bring it back.

The problem started some time after I installed Windows 8, but I just rolled back to Windows 7 with a clean install and reinstalled drivers and the same old problem. (Granted, the problem was worse with Windows 8, to the point where my laptop often wouldn't even detect the Nvidia card.) 

I've hounded Lenovo support for help. Over the phone, they're incompetent. Online, silence. I've nagged Nvidia for help. Same thing."

nvidia,[deleted],0,1,"Hardware not detected GTX 670So I just built my first PC today.

Whenever I insert the CD that came with my 670 and try install the drivers it just says no hardware detected. 

Also, when I go to my system properties it an go to rating it says that my graphics are ""Desktop performance for windows Aero!

Whats going on?"
nvidia,Randomia13,33,3,"Which card have you got and how are you liking it?Hey guys im really interested in what setups you guys have going on and how happy you are with it. Im debating between the 660, 660 ti and 670 in AUS so im not quite sure yet. How are your setups going?"
nvidia,GenghisFrog,4,4,"New to NVidia. PhysX performance question.I recently got a pair of GTX 670s for my PC.  I had always used AMD the past few generations so I was excited to see what PhysX is all about.  I'm finding performance to be pretty bad with it though, but it seems to be because something is horribly broken when it is enabled in a game.  In most games with PhysX running neither of my GPUs will go over 50-60% utilization causing FPS in games like Planetside 2 to just go to crap, if I am in an area with PhysX effects going on.  If I turn PhysX off or go somewhere with no effects usage scales up to 100% on each card when needed.  I've tried setting PhysX to card 1 and 2 and auto and get the same results.  

I actually get better performance if I disable SLI and dedicate one to PhysX only.  In planetside 2 for instance the card that is left doing PhysX never really goes above 20% usage, so with sli shouldn't I expect the card not doing PhysX to say hit 80% usage while the card handling PhysX hits 100%?  I would like both GPUs to be used to there highest potential, and I don't want to have to turn SLI on and off all the time.

I just fired up mirrors edge, which as you know is an old game and my system should be able to crush it, which it does.  Both cards sit at like 30% at 1440p with everything maxed.  Except there was a portion with some PhysX stuff going on and my fps dropped to 50fps but both cards were at 52% usage.  

Am I missing something?  

specs are
i5 3570k @ 4.5
sli gtx 670s overclocked to 1267
8gb ram
etc etc"
nvidia,Jack_Hinrichs,5,3,"Nvidia gtx 660 ti power edition. Input lag...I feel like I'm missing something obvious. I just built this PC last week and it runs great overall, but when i use vsync in Call of Duty: Black ops 2, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, I get horrible input lag. Battlefield 3 runs like butter with vsync on. 

The thing thats confusing me is that my old LAPTOP ran better with vsync than my 1200$ gaming rig. 

If anyone has any tips or ideas it would be greatly appreciated."
nvidia,dhillbobby,13,5,"670, 680 or wait for 700 series?I've been looking for a new graphics card for a while and, being a fps whore, i want to get the best i possibly can.

nvidia,Vinnyk84,2,0,gtx 570 to gtx 780.....is it worth it?Looking to upgrade my evga gtx 570 1.2gb to a gtx 780(5gb if possible) think its worth the money or should i wait a little longer (800 series maybe). MY main downfall is the low gpu memory.
